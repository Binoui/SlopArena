# Testing and Verification

For gateway operations set `ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE` to your own runtime-issued terminal handle; the gateway verifies its incarnation and fails closed if it is missing or mismatched. Use the canonical gateway in [`docs/contributing/unity-cli.md`](contributing/unity-cli.md) and the [shared Editor coordination protocol](file:///home/binoui/Documents/projects/sloparena-workspace/docs/unity-editor-coordination.md). Wait for an independent lease; never inject work into an owner's batch. Runtime ownership status replaces historical Markdown ownership; blocked or unknown is not free.

## Local iteration

Source or asset tuning uses the existing Editor development catalog and the affected
Ability Lab or Training path. A source edit can be compiled in memory without changing
`content-cooked`, generated animation catalogs, or roster pins. Invalid source blocks
preview with diagnostics, not stale fallback. Recompile for changed C#/Shared plugin, or
when Unity requests compilation; do not force a project recompile for prose or every JSON
numeric edit. Read current Unity errors and exercise the changed behavior. Local-only
preview is not persisted package verification.

## Integrated change

Shared edits require focused behavioral coverage while iterating, then `dotnet build
src/Shared/ --nologo` and `dotnet test tests/Shared.Tests/ --nologo` at delivery. Before a
build that copies the Unity plugin, coordinate saved-source writers and acquire your own
bounded gateway hold; run the build from a separate shell while held, wait for import and
compile settlement, then end the hold. Never copy into another owner's active Editor or
nested-claim while holding. Server edits require `dotnet build src/Server/ --nologo` and
`dotnet test tests/Server.Tests/ --nologo`. Unity-facing behavior needs the affected
runtime check and current compile/console evidence, not all unrelated scenes. Accepted
character source/asset changes intended to ship cross the explicit cook/inspect/roster-
refresh boundary before delivery. Documentation/tooling-only edits use the Python checks
from the documentation checker; no Shared build or Unity session is required for this
cleanup.

## Distributable demo

Cook changed accepted packages, verify exact roster identities and all required payloads
in fresh publish outputs, then build and exercise the packaged client/server
join-to-rematch path. The server project and release scripts derive required package IDs
from the roster manifest and verify all four payloads for each admitted package.

### Shared build and tests

`src/Shared/` is pure C# `netstandard2.1`. Run after Shared changes:

```bash
dotnet build src/Shared/ --nologo
dotnet test tests/Shared.Tests/ --nologo
```

Use a focused test filter while iterating, then run the full Shared suite before delivery. Tests should assert observable simulation behavior: state transitions, timing boundaries, collision, damage/Knockback, interruption, deterministic serialization, and catalog identity. Avoid assertions tied only to implementation details or volatile test totals.

Keep mechanic and reporting tests independent of incidental roster tuning. Use explicit
empty-slot fixtures rather than assuming a work-in-progress move remains empty, and assert
facing/lock transitions directly instead of pinning unrelated movement distances. Full-jump
setups must hold through both JumpSquat and the short-hop decision window. Multi-hit tests
should count accepted contacts, not gaps between hitboxes whose active windows may overlap.

Use `TestHelpers.EngineDef` for generic Shared mechanics and reporting tests. It returns
a fresh definition with explicit movement/body values and sixteen empty canonical cooked
slots; install only the timelines or synthetic poses needed by the scenario. Do not load
roster baked data for this fixture. `MankiDef`, `FightGuyDef`, `WibouDef`, and `ResolveDef`
are for intentional roster/package integration. `CombatDef` remains a roster-backed kit
fixture, not the default body for synthetic collision or rollback tests.

Assert the mechanic being protected: authored-duration lock/unlock, accepted contact,
facing/target identity, jump transitions, and deterministic replay. Do not freeze a
character's current damage, startup, body offset, weapon pose, or complete state snapshot
when the test only needs an engine rule. Keep deliberately kit-specific behavior separate;
ordinary numerical tuning does not require golden regeneration.

Kit contact scenarios must run through their authored active windows, not a fixed
short tick budget. Check apex release on the observed ascent-to-descent transition.
Cross-up whiffs must pass the opponent's actual position with nonzero momentum
before release; pushbox displacement alone is not cross-up evidence. Stage-directed
recovery may activate a recovery Slot even when an opponent is outward of the stage.

Fixture isolation verified 2026-10-02: the full Shared suite passed with 1,137 tests,
zero failures and two existing skips. A real Shared simulation smoke separated short/full
hops, reflected an explicit fixture jump-force change, and retained the same engine launch
after process-local Manki movement/body perturbation. All 87 protected character-source,
cooked-content and generated-package file hashes matched the pre-cleanup baseline.

### Targeted contract tests

Choose tests that cover the changed boundary:

- movement, jump, forward air dodge, ledge, and air-use behavior;
- hitbox/projectile geometry and collision;
- Hitstun, Hitstop, Knockback, Combo Influence, Clash, and Burst;
- cooked timeline execution, typed operations, capability admission, interruption, and presentation events;
- package compiler diagnostics, deterministic bytes, manifest/hash validation, and Match Content Catalog admission;
- codecs and server/client content requirements.

New observable behavior needs a behavioral test when existing coverage would not fail for a plausible regression. Keep tests in `tests/Shared.Tests/` and use the existing helpers and fixtures.

### Package and cook checks

For a package change, observe status first: `held`/`releasing` means invoke a gateway command and let it wait for an independent lease; `blocked`/unknown means stop. `free`, settled, and zero active operations are availability observations, not a reservation. Each command independently acquires its lease.

```bash
bun /home/binoui/Documents/projects/sloparena-workspace/scripts/unity-editor-gateway.ts status --project-path /home/binoui/Documents/projects/SlopArena/client/Unity
bun /home/binoui/Documents/projects/sloparena-workspace/scripts/unity-editor-gateway.ts --project-path /home/binoui/Documents/projects/SlopArena/client/Unity -- sloparena.character.inspect --target <package>
bun /home/binoui/Documents/projects/sloparena-workspace/scripts/unity-editor-gateway.ts --project-path /home/binoui/Documents/projects/SlopArena/client/Unity -- sloparena.character.cook --target <package>
```

For a rostered package, require a successful semantic result, valid inspect status,
`dirtyOrStale: false`, and matching source/cooked/package hashes. For a source-only probe,
require successful package resolution plus structured diagnostics and semantic cook failure
only when the probe intentionally has unresolved bindings. A failed cook must preserve the
last valid artifact; with no prior artifact, verify the cooked directory remains absent.
Check `content-cooked/<package>/` and the exact roster requirement only when the package is
built-in.

### Bonk pipeline probe evidence

The Bonk probe is not gameplay coverage. Record:

- inspect `success: true`, `packageId: bonk`, and sixteen canonical slots;
- cook semantic `success: true` with the shared dash/hit bindings;
- cooked payload hashes and preservation of `content-cooked/bonk/` after any later failure;
- package-specific stale tracking after Bonk source/catalog/dependency notifications;
- one queue request for repeated notifications, with unrelated package statuses unchanged;
- Unity recompile status and current console errors.

`KitScenario` golden tests begin only after an approved Bonk kit and successful cooked
package exist. The probe deliberately has no damage, timing, recovery, or capability
contract to golden-test.

The maintained FightGuy check is:

```bash
scripts/verify-fightguy-package.sh
```

### Ability Lab and Unity Training

For integrated Unity-facing changes and accepted package verification:

1. Observe gateway status. If `held`/`releasing`, invoke a gateway command and let it wait for an independent lease; stop on `blocked`/unknown. `free`, settled, and zero active operations are availability observations only. Recompile the Editor when code or the Shared plugin changed, and inspect current Unity errors.
2. Run `EditorDevelopmentContentSelfTest.Run()` (or the named menu item) when
   content-resolution or cook behavior changed. A valid `character.json` edit must
   change the next Editor Training catalog without changing `content-cooked` or the
   generated animation catalog bytes. An invalid operation must report
   `value.out-of-range` at `character.operation.tick` with its code, path, and message,
   block the local catalog, and never use the old persisted package.
3. Confirm `TryBuildPersistedLocalMatchCatalog` still loads the exact persisted roster
   requirement and hashes. Keep the existing `content-cooked` package/release verification.
4. Open the affected package in Ability Lab, preview a valid persisted cooked draft,
   then open Training and exercise movement, the changed move, collision, interruption,
   and landing behavior. Landing presentation crossfades the current aerial pose into
   idle over the replicated `LandingLagTicks / 60` seconds; ordinary zero-lag landings
   transition directly to locomotion, and hitstun interrupts the blend.


#### Native Ability Lab scenario verification

Use the real two-fighter UI or native commands before considering eval. The
command runner uses Shared simulation; never infer hit success from command
success. A focused native pass can exercise these outcomes:

```bash
bun /home/binoui/Documents/projects/sloparena-workspace/scripts/unity-editor-gateway.ts --project-path /home/binoui/Documents/projects/SlopArena/client/Unity -- sloparena.lab.open --target fightguy
bun /home/binoui/Documents/projects/sloparena-workspace/scripts/unity-editor-gateway.ts --project-path /home/binoui/Documents/projects/SlopArena/client/Unity -- sloparena.lab.run --action ground.1 --ticks 60 --distance 1.2 --opponent idle
bun /home/binoui/Documents/projects/sloparena-workspace/scripts/unity-editor-gateway.ts --project-path /home/binoui/Documents/projects/SlopArena/client/Unity -- sloparena.lab.run --action ground.1 --ticks 60 --distance 1.2 --opponent shield
bun /home/binoui/Documents/projects/sloparena-workspace/scripts/unity-editor-gateway.ts --project-path /home/binoui/Documents/projects/SlopArena/client/Unity -- sloparena.lab.run --action ground.1 --ticks 60 --distance 12 --opponent idle
bun /home/binoui/Documents/projects/sloparena-workspace/scripts/unity-editor-gateway.ts --project-path /home/binoui/Documents/projects/SlopArena/client/Unity -- sloparena.lab.run --action grab --ticks 60 --distance 0.7 --opponent idle
```

Inspect semantic `data.result.success` and diagnostics, plus actual
`scenario.frames[]`, accepted `contacts[]`, grab `interactions[]`,
`presentationEvents[]`, and `deaths[]`. Confirm hit damage/knockback and later
state, block as zero-damage blocked contact, miss as no contact/damage, and grab
capture/release as interaction transitions rather than fabricated hit records.
Frame 0 corresponds to MatchTick 1. Preview and capture with `--action`; capture
must use the matching recorded run/options. It restores prior scenario/cursor,
playback, visibility, camera and render target; verify restoration and cache
outputs where capture is part of the change. Authoring timeline's duration
endpoint remains `durationTicks - 1`, not scenario frame numbering.

Scenarios prepare current source in memory through existing compiler, verified
poses/catalog/rig without save, cook, Undo change or source/cooked writes.
Persisted authoritative preview still depends on valid baked runtime/pose/
catalog/rig data; missing/invalid pose/rig blocks execution. Interpret `dirty`
as workspace edit state and `authoritativePreview` independently. These
isolated scenarios do not prove online behavior or game feel. Use the
[Unity CLI reference](contributing/unity-cli.md) and
[Ability Lab guide](systems/ability-lab.md) for errors, options and output
contracts.

#### Ability Lab scenario evidence (2026-09-30; finalized 2026-10-01)

- Native FightGuy ground.1 at distance 1.2 idle produced one accepted hit at
  frame 5 / MatchTick 6 for 4 damage; distance 12 produced no hit; shield at
  distance 1.2 produced one blocked zero-damage contact.
- Shared grab at distance 0.7 against idle and shield captured at frame 7 /
  MatchTick 8 and released at frame 19 / MatchTick 20 with 6 damage; distance
  12 whiffed. Capturing grab frames 0, 7, 13 and 19 retained the 0.7 m run
  and restored the previous frame 48. Real pair PNGs were inspected at
  `.ability-lab-cache/scenario-verification-grab-20260930`.
- Final Shared dependency build succeeded with 17 warnings and zero errors.
  Focused shield/defense/grab/release tests: 67 passed. Full Shared suite:
  1,111 passed, 43 failed, 6 skipped; no baseline comparison establishes
  attribution, and a green full suite is not claimed.
- Final Unity compilation reported completed, failed=false, errors=[].
  Scenario Outcomes, Scenario Commands, and Scenario Controls menus passed;
  all success markers were observed and current console returned zero errors.
  Checks cover final-Hitstop pose freezing, exact shield collision surfaces,
  guard replay, missing-binding preservation, native contact/interaction
  verdicts, cross-action grab defaults, distinct rendered PNG frames, actual
  UI scrubbing/outcome text, authoring exit, and complete restoration.
  The active Frontend scene remained clean with three roots and Editor stopped.
- The read-only Shared `ServerSimulation.LastTickAttackEntities` diagnostic
  exposes the exact latest attack-collision surfaces, including active
  shields; it complements accepted `contacts[]` and does not change gameplay.
- Desktop screenshot provider did not see Unity; no Unity UI screenshot claim.
  Full Frontend selftest was not run because it saves/cooks content. No online
  match or game-feel claim.

Manual checklist: open FightGuy and view both fighters/Scenario Controls; run
ground.1 at close idle, close shield, and distant idle settings and check
contacts/state; run close and distant grab and inspect paired capture/release
versus whiff; scrub/capture a matching recorded run and confirm prior cursor,
playback, visibility and camera/render target return; verify semantic failures
and diagnostics for invalid action/frame and unsupported Play Mode. Do not save
or cook for these scenarios.

Local iteration uses the transient development catalog and affected runtime path; it
does not require this persisted-catalog self-test for every numerical tuning edit.

The authoritative preview is the cooked Shared path for accepted content. Ability Lab
may show a clearly non-authoritative editing pose for invalid drafts, but Training and
matches must never silently use invalid or stale content.

### Local GameServer/PvP

When the change crosses networking or match composition:

```bash
dotnet build src/Server/ --nologo
dotnet test tests/Server.Tests/ --nologo
```

Exercise a local two-client match where practical. Verify that the GameServer admits the
exact cooked package set, clients receive the same content requirements, attacks resolve
from server state, and respawn/stock flow remains intact. Use [Netcode Architecture](systems/netcode-architecture.md)
for packet and reconciliation details; do not duplicate volatile wire layouts here.

#### Server verification layers

Treat these as separate gates, not interchangeable evidence:

| Layer | Proves | Does not prove |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared tests | Deterministic simulation, codecs, content admission | Socket delivery or Unity presentation |
| GameServer tests | Covered server orchestration contracts | A complete live match |
| Master tests (separate repository) | HTTP/SignalR auth, lobby/chat rules, launch requests | PostgreSQL behavior, real GameServer launch, Unity input |
| Local full stack | Actual HTTP/SignalR and UDP lifecycle with real processes | Internet latency/loss, deployment, two-human playability |
| Remote packaged clients | Deployed connectivity and observed human gameplay | Untested failure modes or sustained capacity |

In the Master repository, run:

```bash
dotnet test MasterServer.Tests/MasterServer.Tests.csproj --nologo \
  --logger trx --results-directory /tmp/sloparena-master-results
```

The maintained Master README documents startup, environment variables, and hub
contracts. Its integration tests use real ASP.NET handlers and SignalR clients over
TestServer long polling, isolated EF InMemory databases, and a substituted external
match launcher. Passing them does not prove PostgreSQL transactions or TCP/WebSocket
delivery. Use an isolated PostgreSQL database for the full-stack persistence gate;
do not suppress transaction warnings in production to make an InMemory fixture pass.

#### Local full-stack setup

1. Start a **local Master** using its README, an isolated development database, and
   development-only signing credentials. Record the actual listening URL. Never
   reuse production credentials or point this test at production by accident.
2. Build the GameServer, then make a temporary copy of `src/Server/server.json`.
   Select `deploymentProfile: development` explicitly. Set `masterServerUrl` to
   that listener, `publicIp` to `127.0.0.1` for a same-machine run, an unused base
   `port`, and `arenaDataDir` to the intended baked arenas. TCP control uses the
   base port; UDP match ports span `port` through
   `port + maxConcurrentMatches - 1`. Use reachable public addresses for remote
   clients; do not advertise loopback.
3. Launch the real executable with that explicit configuration:

   ```bash
   dotnet src/Server/bin/Debug/net8.0/SlopArena.Server.dll /absolute/path/to/test-server.json
   ```

   Confirm successful registration and heartbeats in the logs, not merely a
   listening control port. An unavailable Master causes bounded retries; bad
   host credentials or configuration fail startup. Check the selected arena and
   admitted package hashes rather than accepting fallback content as evidence.
4. Configure both clients' Master endpoint **before launch authentication**. Use two
   packaged clients for the remote acceptance pass. One Unity client plus a real
   protocol peer is useful for diagnosis, but is not two-client UI or human-feel proof.
   Use the [Unity CLI workflow](contributing/unity-cli.md) for Editor operations.
5. Confirm distinct player IDs/tags, matching admitted content, and Unity Fixed Timestep
   of 1/60 second. Record the registration/server ID, match ID, and assigned UDP port.

There is currently no maintained one-command full-stack chat smoke harness. The
2026-09-17 pass used a temporary local Master/UDP-peer fixture that was removed after
verification; do not refer to it as an available repository command.

#### Match, membership, and chat acceptance

Run the normal lifecycle first, then repeat it with controlled failures:

| Scenario | Required observation |
| --- | --- |
| Join Room → Character/Arena selection → Match | Two clients receive the same Match admission content; Room chat stays isolated from other Rooms even on one GameHost |
| Combat → stocks/respawn → completion | Damage and outcomes agree with server state; the GameHost's authenticated report returns only the matching Room to Lobby while Results remains viewable |
| Results → Room → rematch | Return validates current membership; picks and Lock-in reset; a new Match starts with fresh IDs while Room conversation and drafts survive |
| GameHost unavailable or full | Room members can prepare/chat without a GameHost; failed start preserves choices for retry, with explicit feedback |
| Room leave, expiry, revocation, or switch | Player returns to browser with an explanation; old Room draft/history is cleared and Room pushes stop; Global and Direct remain usable |
| Hub disconnect/reconnect during gameplay | Same identity/tag; only currently authorized Room restores Server Chat history; gameplay connectivity is separate |
| Offline/rate-rejected send | Draft retained, readable feedback, no automatic replay; uncertain delivery is not presented as confirmed failure |
| Direct, rename, mute | Direct stays private; recipient identity is ID-based; rename does not retarget a conversation; local mute filters the sender |
| Compose during combat | Movement/attacks/camera shortcuts suppressed, simulation and damage continue, Escape preserves draft, held controls require release |
| Invalid or mismatched content | Admission fails explicitly; neither client proceeds with stale/substituted content |

Then exercise the boundaries independently:

- Interrupt **SignalR and UDP separately**. A restored chat connection is not proof of
  recovered gameplay. Record both transports' state and the exact recovery behavior.
- Disconnect the leader during selection and a player during a Match. Check
  leader transfer, roster state, Match cleanup, and whether the remaining client can continue.
- Restart a GameHost and cancel a Match for missing players. Neither cancellation
  invents a winner or resets another Room, and old reports must not reset a rematch.
- Leave a browser open as another player creates, fills, starts and finishes a
  Room; rows must refresh without a manual scan. Cancel a slow Room create/join,
  then re-enter; stale cleanup must not revoke a newly adopted Room.
- Crash a GameHost without deregistration after a Match starts. After 60 seconds
  without a heartbeat and a failed control `/health`, only its open Matches
  cancel with `host_unavailable`; a reachable `/health` must not abort a fight
  merely because Master missed a heartbeat. Recheck no winner and Room chat.
- In explicit Editor development UDP, an unfilled Room Match abort must correlate
  its root Match ID, leave gameplay without Results, and return to that Room.
- Restart Master separately; record lost in-memory Room state and surfaced errors.
- Run two concurrent Matches on one GameHost and repeated join/leave/rematch cycles.
  Check isolation, Room state, result association, and cross-Room chat boundaries.
- On an isolated test network, introduce latency, jitter, loss, and a brief outage.
  Record the actual impairment settings and remove them afterward. No network-fault
  tool is assumed installed; do not alter the development machine's shared route blindly.
- Exercise real credential renewal and expiry without silently creating another guest.
  Keep tokens and signing secrets out of saved evidence.

#### Evidence and next-pass priorities

Capture server/client logs with timestamps, player/server/match IDs, package hashes,
transport state, authoritative and local ticks, observed action/phase, result-report
HTTP status, and Unity console errors. Keep TRX files and screenshots outside Unity
`Assets`. Distinguish process startup, successful admission, actual packet receipt,
and successful UI transition. Do not force a client into Results to claim lifecycle
success. Restore test preferences, Editor scene/view settings, processes, and temporary
configuration when finished.

The 2026-09-17 chat pass completed a real local match → Results → rematch and explicit
Leave using Unity plus a protocol peer. It also repaired accidental Training ownership
in the PvP scene and corrected Unity's 50 Hz fixed loop to 60 Hz. This was not a broad
server reliability sign-off: local prediction still lagged authoritative state
(one sample: local Countdown at tick 5507 versus server GO at tick 5597), and the full
Shared suite still had gameplay/content failures. The next pass should prioritize:

1. Reproduce and diagnose prediction/phase divergence with both clients' tick evidence.
2. Establish the full Shared failure baseline; do not label unclassified failures pre-existing.
3. Verify PostgreSQL result persistence and the complete lifecycle with two packaged clients.
4. Exercise reconnects, restarts, impaired networks, and concurrent match isolation.

The gitignored root `TESTING-UNITY.md` records the session-specific checks. Temporary
evidence under `/tmp/sloparena-chat-evidence/` is local and disposable, not durable CI
coverage or a prerequisite for running this procedure.

### Verification evidence

Record:

- commands run and whether they passed;
- package/cook status and hashes when content changed;
- Unity console status and the Training/Ability Lab surface exercised;
- the local server/client path exercised when applicable;
- any unexercised runtime surface.

Do not claim a live runtime result from a build or static inspection alone.

### Steam Playtest release repair evidence — 2026-10-01

- Full Shared suite after the integrated repairs: **1,165 passed, 6 existing skips,
  zero failures**. Server suite: **26 passed**. MasterServer suite: **158 passed**;
  its registration/launcher suites also passed all **40** cases after independent
  protocol-4 fixtures were finalized.
- The isolated backend smoke exercised actual Master HTTP registration with EF
  InMemory storage: protocol 2 returned 400 without creating a host; protocol 4
  returned 200 and persisted the approved host. It does not prove PostgreSQL or
  live VPS behavior.
- Snapshot smoke retained shield-drop timer 6 through wire decode, corrected air
  timer 999 to 37, and preserved local-only attack timer 500. Legacy snapshot
  collision and lock acquisition are covered by the passing Shared suite.
- Unity reported ready/stopped with zero current console errors. The initial repaired
  Windows `0.2.0-playtest.4` candidate built successfully with **1,309 warnings and
  zero errors**, with its four cooked packages matching the checkpoint roster.
  The operator subsequently approved the coherent Manki renderer/weapon/binding
  update for the final source-pinned rebuild. The packaged VPS endpoint and matching
  Steam native library were checked; developer bootstrap/private config files were
  absent. Final build/source/content identities belong in the release receipt.
- Existing project credits, MIT license, and both font OFL licenses accompany the
  candidate. Release evidence is retained under ignored `build/playtest/0.2.0-playtest.4/`.
- The attempted Proton player smoke was cancelled at the operator's request; no
  subsequent player launch, Steam install, or two-account match/rematch was
  exercised. Source publication, redacted history scan, Steam upload, and live
  deployment are separate gated operations; see the rollout evidence below.

### Steam Playtest rollout — 0.2.0-playtest.4

- Final Windows build: **3 warnings, zero errors**, game source `f830ad2`,
  Master source `f016616`. Steam upload succeeded as **BuildID 25663418**,
  depot **5325921**, manifest **5276771382055694993**.
- VPS release **`steam-playtest-20261001-4`** was deployed through the guarded
  release procedure using the immutable images in the local release receipt.
  Zero active matches were observed before replacement. Both Master and
  GameHost `/ready` passed, as did public HTTPS Master readiness; fresh host
  registration reports **protocol 4** and catalog
  `2d31ca65507f8ce30a2fae29aa1a2bd507da6cce4905a3543f98f678ad8e441a`.
- The database advanced from `20260926000000_AddSteamMatchRouting` to
  `20260927000001_HashGameServerApiTokens`. A fresh off-host archive was
  downloaded, checksum-verified, and restored on an internal-only Docker
  network; migration history, persisted table counts, and isolated Master
  readiness passed. Token hashing is irreversible: the older application pair
  is not a schema-compatible rollback.
- Initial startup failed because production images require explicit
  `Room__AdmittedCharacters__*`, `Room__AdmittedArenas__*`, and
  `Room__CatalogHash`. Adding the approved Manki/FightGuy/Wibou/Bonk roster,
  `slop_pit`/`slop_court`, and the exact catalog pin to the private Master
  environment enabled a successful guarded roll-forward. Existing secrets
  were preserved; no public guest or gameplay UDP fallback was enabled.
- The installed isolated recovery fixture also lacked mandatory Steam auth
  configuration. Its explicit Steam readiness-test fields and inherited
  non-secret room admissions are now represented in `deploy/vps/recovery.py`.
  A readiness test key is not a publisher key and does not prove ticket admission.
  The corrected installed fixture also completed a fresh post-migration
  off-host restore: all seven migration IDs, persisted table counts, and
  isolated Master readiness passed; its temporary containers/network/volume
  were removed.
- Authenticated Steamworks confirms **default → BuildID 25663418**, depot
  manifest **5276771382055694993**, after the Steam mobile confirmation request.
  The separate `test` branch remains on **25547241**. The branch observation
  and cropped screenshot are retained in the local release evidence directory.
- Receipts and private VPS operator evidence retain the observed release,
  image/source identities, backups, recovery, and registration. A packaged
  two-account match/rematch remains unverified; no player was launched.
