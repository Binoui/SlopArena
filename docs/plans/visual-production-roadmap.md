# SlopArena Visual Production Roadmap

**Status:** Active execution roadmap — 2026-08-20
**Direction source:** [`visual-identity-discovery.md`](visual-identity-discovery.md)  
**Goal:** Make the mechanically complete demo look intentional, readable, and inviting enough to attract players and future contributors.

This roadmap coordinates presentation work. It does not replace the PvP or character-kit roadmaps. Finished abilities remain the demo's gameplay blocker; visual work should use presentation-only seams and avoid destabilizing simulation.

## Product target

SlopArena should read as **mischievous, energetic, and slightly unruly**: graphic-stylized 3D, strong silhouettes, controlled neutral scenes, and brief spectacle at meaningful combat moments.

The target is not a collection of individually impressive assets. It is one coherent match:

1. An arena establishes a recognizable place.
2. Fighters remain readable during neutral play.
3. Movement and attacks communicate intent before contact.
4. Hits communicate strength and direction immediately.
5. KO, stock, and result moments provide a satisfying arc.
6. Menus and HUD feel like the same game.

## Locked principles

- **Gameplay readability first.** Neutral play stays clean; heavy hits and KOs may briefly dominate.
- **Server events drive presentation.** VFX, camera, and audio react to authoritative or predicted simulation events; they never alter gameplay state.
- **Shared grammar, character flavor.** Universal timing and strength tiers carry gameplay meaning. Character layers add identity without replacing that grammar.
- **Normals stay restrained.** Their accents expose motion and active timing. Specials own persistent particles, larger silhouettes, and richer secondary effects.
- **One gameplay camera is the judge.** Every visual slice is reviewed in motion at the real match camera, not only in Scene view or a promotional still.
- **Collision and render shells stay separate.** Decorative stage assets never become authoritative gameplay geometry.
- **Hybrid assets, unified treatment.** Generated, free, purchased, and custom sources are acceptable when materials, palette, lighting, scale, and VFX make them coherent.
- **No asset shopping before a demonstrated gap.** Prototype with current content first; replace only what presentation cannot rescue.
- **Record provenance.** Official assets retain author, source, license, editable source, dependencies, modifications, and AI/tool disclosure.

## Current baseline

### Implemented or prototyped

- Five player-facing arena layouts: **Slop Court**, **Splash Deck**, **After Hours**, **Rec Center Roof**, and **Picnic Panic**.
- A separate **Training Lab** designed for measurement and debugging rather than Stage Select.
- Per-stage atmosphere controls and a first shared `MatchVisualStyle` lighting/material treatment.
- A graphic character-shader prototype with player-color separation.
- Shared light, medium, heavy, and launch impact tiers driven by accepted simulation hits.
- One pooled impact renderer used by Training and PvP.
- Authored bone trails on some normal attacks.

### Provisional or missing

- Arena geometry and props are visual prototypes, not final render shells.
- Lighting, character materials, and rim treatment are not yet a locked style.
- Existing bone ribbons look generic and overstate normal attacks.
- No deliberate movement-start, jump, landing, fast-fall, launch-dust, KO, or respawn grammar.
- Character-specific hit layers are mostly absent.
- Functional HUD, menus, transitions, and results remain visually basic.
- Combat audio has not received the same strength-tiered presentation pass.

## Milestone 1 — Shared combat readability

**Outcome:** Attacks read clearly before, during, and after contact without turning every normal into a special.

### 1.1 Replace bone ribbons with normal-attack accents — FightGuy approved

Replace continuous glowing bone trails with a pooled accent system tied to authored attack timing.

Working contract:

- Spawn only around active hitbox frames, with limited anticipation when an animation needs it.
- Build a short tapered arc or compressed afterimage from recent limb/weapon motion.
- Let motion speed and authored attack strength drive width, length, and opacity.
- Keep a typical normal visible for roughly 4–8 frames.
- Use one primary shape for light normals; allow one restrained secondary fragment for heavy normals.
- Remove glow during idle and ordinary recovery.
- Use character color as an accent, not a full-screen light source.
- Share timing and pooling infrastructure while permitting different surfaces:
  - FightGuy: blunt crescents and compressed blue-white afterimages.
  - Manki: rough arcs with sparse sparks or smoke wisps.
  - Kistu: narrow blade arcs and glints.
  - Nilus: thin unstable void tears.

**Gate:** Project-owner approval in the normal gameplay camera.
FightGuy's full grounded/aerial normal set was approved on 2026-08-19: paths remain
legible at gameplay zoom, effects clear before neutral, and normals remain visually
distinct from specials. Character-specific rollout beyond FightGuy remains pending.


### 1.2 Add movement and environment feedback — first pass approved

- Dash uses continuous world-space speed residue for the full authoritative dash state.
- Jump and landing use smoke-only puffs; double jump and heavy landing add horizontal rings.
- Fast fall and launch use short directional streaks.
- `PlayerRenderer` derives every trigger from successive authoritative `CharacterState`
  snapshots; presentation never changes movement or packets.
- Repeated effects use per-kind pools with one lifecycle owner.
- Cartoon FX Remaster Free supplies optional local source art; generated SlopArena variants
  remain ignored under the Asset Store license. See `docs/contributing/conventions.md`.

**Gate:** First gameplay-camera pass approved by the project owner on 2026-08-20. Bright/dark
arena and PvP parity checks remain in `TESTING-UNITY.md`.

### 1.3 Add KO and respawn presentation

- Directional KO streak or boundary response.
- Stock-loss emphasis without hiding remaining fighters.
- Character-colored respawn/materialization burst.
- Clear invulnerability read that does not resemble an attack effect.

**Gate:** A spectator can identify who was eliminated, from which direction, and when the fighter becomes controllable again.

### 1.4 Establish combat-audio tiers

- Shared light, medium, heavy, launch, shield/defense, and KO categories.
- Character layers supplement shared transient and low-end weight.
- Audio follows the same accepted hit event and strength classification as VFX.
- Repeated multihits avoid exhausting or clipping playback.

**Gate:** With the screen obscured, heavy and launch events remain distinguishable from light normals without excessive loudness.

## Milestone 2 — Rendering foundation

**Outcome:** Characters and stages look like one game before expensive asset replacement begins.

### 2.1 Lock one gameplay lighting rig

- Directional key light, controlled ambient fill, contact shadows, and atmospheric depth.
- Conservative bloom and exposure.
- No generic post-processing that reduces silhouette or hit-effect clarity.
- Verify bright and dark stages with the same fighters and camera.

### 2.2 Lock the small material family

- Graphic character material with controlled bands or gradient, consistent texture/value ranges, and optional restrained rim.
- Gameplay-surface, background-architecture, distant/fogged, emissive-accent, and stylized environmental-effect materials.
- Player-color treatment remains readable but does not permanently outline every fighter.
- Prefer a few boring, maintainable shaders over one universal master shader.

### 2.3 Publish the practical style sheet

Record:

- Palette and value hierarchy.
- Fighter/background contrast rules.
- Character and environment material parameters.
- Shared VFX shape, timing, and coverage limits.
- Character-specific flavor boundaries.
- UI shape and typography direction.
- Asset provenance requirements.
- Good and bad gameplay-camera examples.

**Milestone gate:** Neutral screenshots from at least one bright and one dark arena look intentional without debug colors, and a ten-second combat clip stays readable through movement and impacts.

## Milestone 3 — Signature arena vertical slice

**Outcome:** One arena proves the environment-production method and becomes the quality reference for the remaining roster.

### 3.1 Select the signature arena

Compare the five layouts in motion using:

- Recognizable premise and thumbnail silhouette.
- Neutral-play readability.
- Midground landmarks and background vista opportunities.
- Compatibility with the locked lighting/material family.
- Scope achievable without changing collision.

Do not select by concept art alone.

### 3.2 Build its render shell

Keep baked collision untouched. Add separate layers for:

1. Gameplay surface and edge treatment.
2. Midground architecture and props.
3. Background vista and atmosphere.
4. Lighting and environmental motion.
5. Cosmetic response to launches and KOs where useful.

**Gate:** The arena is recognizable from a thumbnail, every playable edge remains readable, decorative assets never affect collision, and performance remains stable with four fighters and combat VFX.

### 3.3 Propagate the method

After the signature arena passes, extract reusable materials, prop rules, atmosphere settings, prefab conventions, and performance budgets. Apply them to the other four arenas without forcing identical scenery.

## Milestone 4 — Character presentation layers

**Outcome:** Every fighter belongs to the shared game while retaining a recognizable visual signature.

FightGuy remains the system testbed; Manki remains the tone and flagship-identity anchor.

For each character:

- Unified material treatment and palette pass.
- Idle, run, jump, landing, hitstun, and death presentation audit.
- Normal-attack accents using the shared restrained contract.
- Character-specific special VFX.
- Character-specific hit flavor layered over shared impact tiers.
- Portrait/icon treatment.
- Spawn, KO, and victory treatment.
- Audio palette.

**Per-character gate:** A neutral movement clip, a normal string, one special, one launch, and one KO are identifiable as that character without abandoning the shared strength grammar.

## Milestone 5 — Whole-shell coherence

**Outcome:** The match no longer jumps between polished combat and prototype menus.

### 5.1 Match HUD — implementation complete, final visual check pending

The match HUD now establishes the shell language:

- Top-left vertical roster with player-color identity, portraits, damage, and stocks.
- Percentage-only spatial markers using the same player colors.
- Icon-first local ability rail with cooldown and press feedback.
- Shared ink-black, dirty off-white, hard-accent, and slightly misregistered poster treatment.
- Browser preview at `tools/hud-preview/` loads the real `Assets/UI/HUD.uss` through a
  small USS-to-browser adapter for fast iteration. Unity remains the final renderer check.

Close this slice with one bounded in-game review: `0%` through `999%` alignment,
four-player spacing, and overhead-marker readability on bright and dark geometry.

### 5.2 Bounded frontend sprint

Propagate the approved HUD language through the playable loop in this order:

1. **Main menu — implementation complete.** The reference composition now uses the
   underground fight-poster broadcast identity: title treatment, roster cards,
   poster-strip actions, focus states, connection/version footer, and a direct
   connect modal.
2. **Shared global chat shell — presentation pass complete.** Main Menu, Lobby,
   Lobby Room, Server Browser, Character Select, Stage Select, and Results now
   use the same compact SC2/WoW-style chat panel. It remains presentation-only
   until the master-server chat contract exists.
3. **Character select** — player number/color ownership, portrait or splash treatment,
   selected character, concise role phrase, and ready state.
4. **Match bridge** — loading, countdown, `FIGHT`, stock loss/KO, match end, results,
   rematch/return actions.
5. **Functional screens by reuse** — server browser, lobby, stage select, settings, and
   pause menu. Do not redesign these independently.

Keep the sprint presentation-only. Reuse existing flow, state, and controls; do not build
a new menu architecture, navigation system, or generalized design-system framework.

**Stop condition:** once main menu → character select → fight → results reads as one
coherent product, stop shell work and return to FightGuy-first character ability completion.


**Milestone gate:** Project-owner approval that a live flow from menu to results contains
no visually unrelated screen, placeholder debug styling, or unexplained instantaneous transition.

## Milestone 6 — Flagship validation

**Outcome:** Demonstrate the game's promise to players and contributors as one coherent live sequence.

Use FightGuy plus the signature arena to play a controlled sequence:

1. Arena introduction.
2. Neutral movement.
3. Dash, jump, and landing.
4. Light and medium contacts.
5. Character-flavored attack.
6. Heavy launch.
7. KO and respawn or match end.
8. HUD and results presentation.

Review the sequence in motion at the normal gameplay camera. Fix discontinuities between systems before adding more assets.

**Release gate:** Project-owner approval that the sequence looks coherent in motion, communicates every major gameplay event without debug UI, and contains no effect or screen that clearly belongs to a different visual language.

## Milestone 7 — Contributor launch

**Outcome:** Let contributors improve the game without requiring them to invent its production rules.

Publish:

- Practical style sheet.
- Source-file and provenance requirements.
- Character and arena contribution templates.
- Technical constraints and acceptance media.
- Example implementation from the flagship slice.
- Small starter tasks: one landing-dust variant, portrait, prop, character idle, heavy-hit flavor layer, environmental motion, or documented playtest report.

Do not begin with unrestricted “make a character” requests. Curated small work establishes trust and teaches the shared grammar.

## Execution order

The immediate queue is:

1. Close the HUD with one final Unity visual check; avoid further open-ended polishing.
2. **Main menu — complete:** underground fight-poster composition, shared chat shell,
   and Direct Connect modal.
3. Apply the approved composition and shared chat shell to character select.
4. Complete loading/countdown, fight, KO, match-end, and results presentation.
5. Stop the bounded UI sprint and return to FightGuy-first character ability completion.
6. After the demo gameplay gate, resume remaining arena, character-presentation, flagship,
   and contributor-launch milestones.

Character ability completion remains the demo blocker and gameplay priority. Menu work is
a short product-coherence pass, not a reason to defer the roster. Visual work must remain
in bounded slices that do not create parallel rewrites of combat, netcode, navigation, or
stage collision.

## Definition of done for every visual slice

A slice is complete only when:

- It is exercised in the real Unity gameplay camera.
- Training and PvP share the same presentation path where the underlying event exists in both.
- Simulation state and packet formats remain unchanged unless separately designed and approved.
- Repeated effects are pooled or otherwise allocation-safe.
- Bright and dark stage readability is checked.
- The project owner approves the result in-game at the normal gameplay camera.
- `TESTING-UNITY.md` contains the remaining human playtest checks.
- Unity script compilation is clean.
- Relevant system documentation describes the final contract.
