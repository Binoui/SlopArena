# Training Box Stage — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-08-01
**Status:** Approved, pending implementation
**Owner:** binoui (new to Unity — spec doubles as a build tutorial)

## Overview

Replace the mismatched visuals in the offline training scene (`Arena_Offline`) with a
dedicated training stage: a 40×40 m closed box with a grey/white checkerboard floor and
walls (1 m squares), plus colored grid lines every 5 m (yellow) and 10 m (red) for
distance judging. Built entirely from Cube primitives so the user learns the editor while
the collision bake reads the exact same geometry — visuals == collision by construction.

## Why

- Current scene shows the `colosseum` fantasy model while `TrainingMatch` loads
  `Island_arena` collision — the two don't match.
- A plain, measurable training room is more useful for ability testing than a themed arena:
  colored grid lines make 5 m/10 m spacing readable at a glance.
- Primitive cubes + a generated checkerboard texture is the most beginner-approachable
  pipeline and requires zero new runtime code.

## Layout (top view, meters, Y-up)

```
              Z=+20  (north wall, solid)
   ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ red ─────┼────┼────┼────┼──── red   │  red lines   = 10 m grid (±10, ±20)
   │  yellow lines at ±5, ±15            │  yellow lines = 5 m grid  (±5, ±15)
   │ floor: 8×8 checkerboard, 1 m squares│
   │ walls: solid cubes, 20 m tall       │
   └────────────────────────────────────┘
              Z=-20  (south wall, solid)
```

### Blocks (all Cube primitives under a `TrainingBox` root)

| Object | Position (x, y, z) | Scale (x, y, z) | Material |
|---|---|---|---|
| Floor | (0, -0.25, 0) | (40, 0.5, 40) | Mat_Checker_Floor |
| Wall_N | (0, 10, 20.25) | (40, 20, 0.5) | Mat_Checker_Wall |
| Wall_S | (0, 10, -20.25) | (40, 20, 0.5) | Mat_Checker_Wall |
| Wall_E | (20.25, 10, 0) | (0.5, 20, 40) | Mat_Checker_Wall |
| Wall_W | (-20.25, 10, 0) | (0.5, 20, 40) | Mat_Checker_Wall |
| 4× yellow strips (5 m grid) | X = ±5, ±15 at Y = 0.02, Z = 0 | (0.15, 0.05, 40) | Mat_Line_5m |
| 4× yellow strips (5 m grid) | Z = ±5, ±15 at Y = 0.02, X = 0 | (40, 0.05, 0.15) | Mat_Line_5m |
| 4× red strips (10 m grid) | X = ±10, ±20 at Y = 0.02, Z = 0 | (0.15, 0.05, 40) | Mat_Line_10m |
| 4× red strips (10 m grid) | Z = ±10, ±20 at Y = 0.02, X = 0 | (40, 0.05, 0.15) | Mat_Line_10m |

Total: 21 cubes (1 floor + 4 walls + 16 strips). Strips sit 2 cm above the floor to avoid
z-fighting; they are 0.15 m wide so they do not visually swallow the 5 m checker squares.

### Spawn points (tagged `SpawnPoint`)

| Marker | Position |
|---|---|
| Player spawn | (8, 0.5, 0) |
| Alt spawn | (-8, 0.5, 0) |

`TrainingMatch` spawns the NPC dummy at a fixed (0, 5, 0), so the player spawn is offset
from center to avoid overlap. The dummy's spawn is not part of the .arena.

## Materials (created as project assets by me)

| Asset | Definition |
|---|---|
| `Mat_Checker_Floor` | Lit material, generated 8×8 checker texture (grey `#909090` / white `#F2F2F2`, Point filter, **Repeat wrap**), tiling (5,5) → 40×40 squares of 1 m on the 40 m floor |
| `Mat_Checker_Wall` | Same texture, tiling (5,2.5) → 40×20 squares of 1 m on a 40×20 m wall face (all four walls share this: every wall has a 40×20 m big face) |
| `Mat_Line_5m` | Lit material, flat yellow `#FFD500` |
| `Mat_Line_10m` | Lit material, flat red `#FF3B30` |

Cube side faces (0.5 m thin) get stretched checker — invisible in practice, no gameplay impact.

## Work Split

### Me (materials, bake, wiring)
1. Generate checkerboard texture + 4 material assets in `Assets/Art/Stages/training_box/`.
2. Bake `TrainingBox` root → `data/arenas/training.arena` (overwrites the stale file from the
   deleted scene) via reflection on `SlopArenaArenaBaker.BakeArena` (driven through the connected
   Unity session). The 16 `Line_` strips are temporarily reparented out of the hierarchy before
   baking so they stay visual-only, then restored.
3. In `Arena_Offline`: delete the `colosseum` visual root, purge the stale `_arenaName` prefab
   override (field renamed to `_arenaNameOverride`), set `_arenaNameOverride` to `training`.

### Execution note (deviations from the split, with user consent)
- The user placed the floor + 4 walls; the 16 grid strips and 2 spawn markers were placed via
  MCP script (`GameObject.CreatePrimitive` + tag) at the user's request after the strips proved
  too tedious to hand-place. Wall height changed from 5 m to 20 m during the build (user choice:
  "real box"; a separate future stage will be wall-less), wall material tiling updated to (8,4).
- The scene's `TrainingMatch` has `_npcAiMode = Idle` (pre-existing override): the dummy stands
  still, which is the intended training behavior.

### User (arranging blocks, placing spawns — coached by me)
1. Create empty root `TrainingBox`.
2. Create the 21 cubes from the table above (GameObject > 3D Object > Cube, set transform,
   drag material from Project view).
3. Create 2 `SpawnPoint`-tagged markers at the table positions.

### Arena key choice
Reuse the existing `training` registry key (`src/Shared/ArenaDefinition.cs`): the baked file
loads with precedence (`loaded ?? ArenaRegistry.Get`), the `training` registry entry already
exists (50×50 bounds, kill height −15, center spawn), so:
- No shared-code changes, no DLL rebuild.
- Stage select already lists "Training Room" — it now points at the real box.

## Verification

1. Bake succeeds → `data/arenas/training.arena` contains floor + 4 walls (5 cubes × 12
   tris = 60 collision triangles) and 2 spawn points.
2. Play `Arena_Offline`: player spawns at (8, 0.5, 0), dummy at center, floor is checkerboard,
   yellow/red grid visible, characters bounce off all 4 walls (can't leave the box).
3. Console shows `[TrainingMatch] Loaded arena from file: .../training.arena`.

## Implementation Notes (discovered during build)

- **Texture wrap must be `Repeat`, not `Clamp`.** With Clamp, any tiling > 1 renders the
  surface solid (UV clamps to the edge texel) — the 1×1 floor tiling masked this until the
  wall/floor tiling exceeded 1. Verified via orthographic top-down renders + pixel analysis
  (40×40 uniform squares, period 1.03 m).
- **Checker grey must be dark enough to survive the lighting.** #C8C8C8 vs #F2F2F2 (16 %
  contrast) is blown out to uniform white by the 1.5-intensity directional light + ACES
  tonemapping in lit areas; #909090 keeps visible contrast in both lit and shadowed regions.
- Vision-model screenshot review is unreliable for grid counts — pixel-level analysis
  (neighbor-diff edge counting, luminance profiles) is the ground truth.

## Out of Scope

- PvP/stage-select changes (the registry entry already covers display).
- Wall decorations, skybox, lighting pass, or art polish.
- Making the strips a separate server collision layer (they are visual-only, 0.05 m tall —
  negligible bump; the checker floor 0.5 m thick is the collision surface).
