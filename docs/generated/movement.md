# Movement data sheet — measured from the real sim (issue #150)

> Generated 2026-08-18 10:08 UTC · scripted inputs on the real ServerSimulation (60 Hz tick). 
> Run: hold right from standstill. Dash: one dash press. Jump: full jump (held past the short-hop 
> window). Short hop: press + release inside the window. Double jump: jump edge at first apex. 
> Drift: stick held through the full hop. Fall: spawned airborne at 50 m (float window skipped). 
> Reversal: cruise right, then full opposite input (pivot skid + re-accel). Stop: release at cruise. 
> Stage-relative rows use the real baked <b>colosseum</b> arena (30.6 m wide). 
> Values are measured (effective behavior, incl. rush kick-off, pivot skids, caps), not authored constants.

## Roster read

What the numbers mean, per character (computed from the measured values above):

- **Manki**: run 12 m/s, dash 4.7 m (15% of stage), jump 1.35 m, air/run 54%, stop 1.7 m. Best at: safest stop. Weakest at: longest dash, highest jump, fastest run, longest airtime, largest air drift, largest stage share per dash.
- **FightGuy**: run 14 m/s, dash 6.3 m (21% of stage), jump 1.90 m, air/run 54%, stop 2.4 m. Best at: longest dash, largest stage share per dash. Weakest at: most ground-dominant (lowest air/run).
- **Kistu**: run 15 m/s, dash 6.0 m (20% of stage), jump 2.24 m, air/run 57%, stop 2.8 m. Best at: highest jump, fastest run, longest airtime, largest air drift. Weakest at: safest stop.
- **Nilus**: run 13 m/s, dash 4.9 m (16% of stage), jump 2.02 m, air/run 54%, stop 2.0 m.

- **Too fast?** Run crosses 31 m in Manki 2.55 s / FightGuy 2.19 s / Kistu 2.04 s / Nilus 2.35 s. Full-hop airtime is 0.53 s / 0.63 s / 0.68 s / 0.67 s vs ~0.25 s reaction — reactable but tight (2-3×). Fast-fall from jump apex: 0.05 s / 0.05 s / 0.07 s / 0.07 s — under reaction, so a fast-fall landing cannot be reacted to; reads must come from the jump start, not the landing.
- **Broken short hop: Manki** — the short-hop impulse rises under the 0.10 m PlatformLandTolerance on the first airborne tick (no upward-velocity gate in the non-hitstun ground snap), so the sim snaps the character back down and the hop never leaves the ground. Fix candidates: raise the impulse above ~6.7 m/s, or add the hitstun-branch's `VY <= 0` gate to the snap.


## Melee comparison

Melee values: docs/research/melee-movement-audit.md (SSBWiki \[community\]; derived frame counts transfer 1:1 — 60 f/s = 60 ticks/s). Absolute speeds don't transfer (u/f vs m/s), timings and ratios do.

| metric | SlopArena (measured) | Melee reference | read |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jump squat | 6 t–4 t–4 t–5 t | 3–8 f (Fox 3, Marth 4, Puff 5, Bowser 8) | in Melee range |
| Full-hop airtime | 0.53 s–0.63 s–0.68 s–0.67 s | Fox ~33 f, Marth 57–59 f | FG/Kistu ≈ Fox-fast, Manki ≈ Marth |
| Short-hop airtime | 0.00 s–0.37 s–0.40 s–0.38 s | Fox ~19 f, Marth 36–38 f | short hop in the fast band |
| Short/full jump force | 0.60–0.60–0.60–0.60 | ≈ 0.58 (derived) | Melee-shaped (0.7 was the pre-audit value) |
| Fast fall / fall | 1.20–1.21–1.21–1.20 | 1.14–1.26 (Fox 3.4/2.8 … Puff 1.6/1.3) | Melee-shaped, adopted (audit §3.4) |
| Air speed / run | 0.54–0.54–0.57–0.54 | 0.38 Fox – 0.5 Marth – 1.23 Puff | upper-mid band — air slower than ground, Melee norm |
| Dash speed / run | 1.56–1.36–1.50–1.51 | 0.8–1.5× (initial dash vs run) | top of Melee band |
| Stop from run | 0.32 s–0.38 s–0.40 s–0.35 s | Fox 27.5 f, Marth 30 f, Puff 12 f | SA brakes faster than Fox/Marth |
| Reversal (cruise→cruise) | 0.55 s–0.62 s–0.67 s–0.60 s | dash-dance pivot ≈ 10–15 f between dashes | SA pivot 2–3× slower — no dash-dance (cooldown) |
| Dash cooldown | 44–60 t | none — dash-dance is core | the big deviation (ADR-0020 kept it) |
