# Visual Presentation Baseline

**Purpose:** Fixed gameplay-camera evidence for comparing later visual work. This baseline records the same match situations across a representative bright and dark arena without changing simulation, combat timing, collision, or presentation behavior.

## Capture contract

- **Camera:** normal gameplay camera from the active match scene; target lock off; default gameplay orbit, pitch, distance, FOV, and follow smoothing; no Scene view, free camera, debug camera, hitbox display, or cinematic framing.
- **Resolution:** capture the rendered game window at 1920×1080; include all on-screen HUD panels and UI elements visible during normal play.
- **Fighters:** FightGuy (P1, blue) versus FightGuy (P2, red), default scale and materials. Use the same character pair for every row.
- **Stages:** `Slop Court` (bright representative arena) and `After Hours` (dark representative arena). If either stage is unavailable in the current build, record the exact substitute and keep it unchanged for the whole capture pass.
- **HUD/state:** normal gameplay HUD visible; debug hitboxes, trajectory ribbons, editor gizmos, and console overlays hidden unless a row explicitly says otherwise.
- **Evidence naming:** `visual-baseline/<stage>/<sequence>.png` and, for moving evidence, `visual-baseline/<stage>/<sequence>.mp4`. Stage path keys: `Slop Court` → `slop_court`; `After Hours` → `after_hours`.
- **Metadata:** every image/video must retain the stage, fighters, camera conditions, build/commit, and reproduction steps recorded below. A capture without metadata is not baseline evidence.

**Capture status:** the manifest is ready, but the evidence index remains incomplete until the gameplay captures are taken and linked. Do not treat this document as complete while any row is `_pending_`.

## Dedicated capture scene

Use `client/Unity/Assets/Scenes/VisualBaselineCapture.unity` for the gameplay rows.
It reuses the normal `TrainingMatch` camera, renderer, HUD, and simulation path while
fixing FightGuy vs FightGuy, target lock off, and an idle NPC so the initial spacing is
repeatable. Change only the serialized `TrainingMatch` arena override between
`slop_court` (bright) and `after_hours` (dark); do not save gameplay state or alter
simulation constants. Capture the results row from the existing `Results` scene after
the normal match flow rather than adding a second results implementation.

## Capture matrix

Each row is captured once in each stage (`Slop Court` and `After Hours`). Use the same camera conditions and fighter setup in both stages. For event rows, capture a short sequence (2 seconds before the event and 2 seconds after) and mark the event frame/time in the metadata.

| ID | Situation | Evidence | Reproduction | Expected camera condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VB-01 | Neutral spacing | PNG + 4 s video | Start both fighters grounded and idle, separated by roughly one dash distance; do not press input. | Stable follow; both silhouettes and HUD panels visible. |
| VB-02 | Dash | PNG at peak dash + video | From neutral spacing, dash P1 toward P2, then from P2 toward P1; one pass each direction. Mark the selected pass and event frame. | Keep both fighters framed; no manual camera correction during dash. |
| VB-03 | Jump | PNG near apex + video | From neutral, perform one full jump and return to ground without pressing LMB, RMB, or special attack buttons. | Preserve ground reference and airborne silhouette. |
| VB-04 | Landing | PNG on landing frame + video | Jump from the default starting platform, then land back on that same platform without using fast-fall; finish grounded before the next row. | Show feet, landing surface, and both fighters. |
| VB-05 | Light hit | PNG at contact + video | At low damage, land FightGuy light ground normal g1 once. | Contact remains visible without hiding the victim or HUD. |
| VB-06 | Heavy hit | PNG at contact + video | At low damage, land FightGuy heavy ground normal g4 once. | Brief event remains readable while both fighters stay identifiable. |
| VB-07 | Launch | PNG immediately after launch + video | At approximately 60% victim damage, land a launcher (g3) and let the victim fly. | Keep launch direction, victim, stage edge, and landing route visible. |
| VB-08 | KO | PNG at KO + video | Raise victim damage, land a horizontal finisher (g4), and record the stock-loss/KO moment. | Do not crop the KO direction or stock UI. |
| VB-09 | Respawn | PNG after materialization + video | Complete the KO flow, then capture the victim's respawn before movement input. | Keep respawning fighter, invulnerability read, and remaining fighter visible. |
| VB-10 | Results | PNG + 6 s video | Finish the match after the KO and wait for the results surface. | Normal results framing; record any transition timing. |

## Evidence index

The table must be populated before merge. Paths are repository-relative or attached artifact links.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| VB-01 | [`vb-01-neutral-spacing.png`](evidence/visual-baseline/slop_court/vb-01-neutral-spacing.png) | _pending_ | `73d1fe9` | Captured in Unity gameplay camera; PNG only; fighters were grounded at capture. |
| VB-02 | _pending_ | _pending_ | _pending_ | |
| VB-03 | _pending_ | _pending_ | _pending_ | |
| VB-04 | _pending_ | _pending_ | _pending_ | |

### Captured evidence

#### VB-01 — Slop Court bright

- Evidence: `docs/evidence/visual-baseline/slop_court/vb-01-neutral-spacing.png`
- Captured in the Unity gameplay surface at commit `73d1fe9`.
- Arena: Slop Court, bright representative arena.
- Fighters: FightGuy P1 blue and FightGuy P2 red.
- Camera: `MainCamera`, normal gameplay camera, target lock off, default framing.
- HUD/debug overlays: normal HUD visible; debug hitboxes and editor overlays off.
- Reproduction: reset `Arena_Offline`, enter play mode, wait for both fighters to settle on the starting platform, capture the rendered game window.
- Observed: both fighters grounded and visible; HUD panels visible; stage edge and foreground geometry partially occlude the lower center.
- Limitation: this is a still capture only. The remaining matrix rows and the dark-arena counterpart still require gameplay capture.

## Comparison rules

Later visual tickets compare the same ID, stage, fighter pair, camera settings, and event timing. A before/after claim must link both baseline evidence and the new capture. If gameplay setup changes, create a new baseline revision instead of silently replacing these records.
