# Combat Systems

This document describes mechanics shared by every SlopArena fighter. Character-specific kit data belongs in the character package; package execution is covered by [Ability Architecture](ability-architecture.md).

## Move model

Each fighter has twelve move concepts, each with grounded and aerial entries:

- normals `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`;
- specials `A`, `E`, `R`, and `F`.

That produces the canonical 16-entry grid. `A` is the signature special, `E` is recovery-capable mobility, `R` is the playmaking special, and `F` is the long-cooldown power special. A package may alias entries in authoring, but cooking expands them into explicit runtime slots. Physical labels such as `LMB` and `RMB` are input mappings, not move identity.

Every move is a fixed-timeline entry with authored stage timing, animation IDs, and typed deterministic operations. The Shared simulation controls activation, duration, collision, interruption, and completion.

## Movement and resources

- Camera-relative 8-direction movement uses one ground Run tier; there is no selectable walk/sprint split.
- Jump and double jump use the character's movement definition. ShortHop is release-timed during the opening jump window.
- FastFall requires a fresh Down press while already descending; it sets and latches the configured downward speed until landing or interruption. Release preserves the latch; ascent/apex and locked/owned presses are discarded. Ordinary aerial attacks may coexist, but Hitstop, Hitstun, ledges and authored vertical motion prevent activation. FastFall overrides any active gravity window.
- Shield is a permanent, full-body grounded defense held with Left Shift / RT. It stops ordinary melee, projectile and explosion attacks from every direction, freezes combat facing, and enters a vulnerable 7-tick drop after release. Grab is C or the controller LB+RT chord.
- Automatic ledge grabs and LedgeHang are disabled for the friends demo. Fighters fall past stage edges; return with jumps, movement, and kit recovery moves.
- Each ability entry can be limited to one use per flight. Landing resets air-use counters.
- RecoveryMove is the per-character return-to-stage move. It is the only ordinary move that resets the FloatWindow mid-air.

All gameplay timing uses 60 Hz ticks. Values are authored in package data and resolved by Shared simulation.

### Permanent shield bubble

While `Shielding`, Shared replaces the fighter's ordinary attack-contact hurtboxes
with one non-shrinking sphere centered on its capsule center. The package-owned
`shieldRadius` is authoritative: FightGuy, Wibou, and Bonk use 1.05 m, Manki
0.95 m. Ordinary melee, projectile, and
explosion hitboxes contact the sphere from every direction, without damage,
reflection, shield-poking, or a meter. The first physical surface contact
determines which fighter a one-hit projectile strikes. Block stun, hitstop,
collision-safe pushback, projectile lifetime, and stable block-event identity
are unchanged. Shared emits the actual first shield-sphere contact before
pushback; Unity positions the tangent ripple on the currently rendered bubble
surface so the effect follows presentation interpolation without moving gameplay.
Unshielded fighters use ordinary baked hurtboxes. Grab capture continues to
check those body hurtboxes, never the expanded shield sphere. The Unity guard
mesh has no collider or combat authority; `PlayerRenderer` follows the
authoritative state and scales it to the same diameter.

### Forward air dodge

A fresh airborne Defense press (Left Shift / RT) starts a facing-locked forward
air dodge if the fighter has an air dodge left and is otherwise actionable.
Holding Defense through a shield-jump does not produce a fresh press. The
first 5 ticks are invulnerable; horizontal movement lasts 10 ticks from
acceptance, so ticks 5–9 are vulnerable. The following 20 ticks are vulnerable
recovery. Movement overrides, rather than adds to, inherited run/slide speed
and stops at tick 10. Gravity and vertical momentum continue. Attacks, jump,
grab, steering, Down/fast-fall and Shield cannot cancel commitment; rejected
edges do not queue. Landing ends movement and invulnerability but retains
all remaining commitment as grounded recovery. Ledge grabs do not interrupt
recovery while the ledge mechanic is disabled. Genuine landing and respawn
replenish the one-use resource; wall contact and hitstun do not.

Initial no-obstacle comparison at 60 Hz (old universal airborne Dash used the
per-character `dashSpeed` and `dashDurationTicks`; the new independently
authored `airDodgeSpeed` runs for 10 ticks). Values are horizontal distance
before collision/landing:

| Fighter | Old peak m/s | Old travel m | Dodge peak m/s | Dodge travel m |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| FightGuy | 20 | 6.667 | 11 | 1.833 |
| Manki | 20 | 6.000 | 11 | 1.833 |
| Wibou | 22 | 5.867 | 12.1 | 2.017 |
| Bonk | 20 | 6.667 | 11 | 1.833 |

Universal airborne Dash input no longer moves the fighter. Kit-owned
dash/lunge/recovery abilities retain their own timing and mobility.

### Contextual Down

Down (X by default) is independent of backward movement. Held Down enters Crouch on an
eligible ground tick; a fresh edge at ≥ .65× RunSpeed enters Slide. A held-Down actionable
landing enters Slide at ≥ .25× RunSpeed, after collision, ability termination and landing
lag. Locked landings bank no slide. Zero-speed landings never gain propulsion.

Slide caps live horizontal magnitude at 1.25× RunSpeed, then decays by 2× RunSpeed per
second without steering. Below .15× RunSpeed it becomes Crouch. The landing contact tick
adds neither a second integration nor slide friction. Crouch brakes at 36 units/s² and
snaps below .015; release restores ordinary control that tick. Slide freezes Rush and
preserves LastDir. Walk-off clears low posture without automatically fast-falling.

SlideJump uses ordinary jump squat, ShortHop and resources. Its takeoff cap is 1.15×
RunSpeed versus ordinary RunSpeed; caps never refill velocity or restore wall-blocked
components. Grounded mobility uses normal movement; character-specific mobility stays in kit abilities.

All four roster packages opt their grounded normals 1–4 into `allowSlideCarry`.
Activation switches immediately to the attack pose, caps existing Slide momentum at
RunSpeed and decays it by 6× RunSpeed per second. Carry freezes during Hitstop and clears
on completion, cancellation, hit or motion takeover. Normal attack locks remain intact.

Default max-fall/fast-fall speeds: FightGuy 14/22, Manki 13.5/21, Bonk 15/24, Wibou 14/22.
The report's historical-fall and 3× slide-friction controls do not change these defaults.

### Settled CrouchBrace

Settlement requires one complete unfrozen, eligible, zero-horizontal-velocity Crouch tick.
An accepted hit snapshots settlement and a valid authored/baked low pose before reaction
cleanup. Ordinary formula launch receives a .90 multiplier on its final vector, after
Hitstun calculation and before directional influence. Damage, Hitstop and Hitstun are
unchanged. Deferred launch applies the captured factor once after Hitstop; late Down does
not earn it and release does not revoke it. Replacement hits and block contact clear/replace the queue. Scripted force, direct velocity overrides and pulls are excluded.

Roster low postures use real static Humanoid poses and matching baked hurtboxes, not
smaller stage capsules. Missing legacy low poses remain upright and cannot earn brace.

### Measured flow report

`dotnet run --project tools/AerialApproachReport -- --slide-flow --slide-deceleration 2
--fall-profile current --brace-multiplier 0.9 --assert --out artifacts/slide-flow/combat`
writes per-tick traces, aerial approaches, follow-ups and resolver target outcomes.
Use `3` for the friction control, `previous` for historical fall speeds and `1` to disable
brace in the report only. Each profile measures 140,640 movement scenarios plus recovery
ownership controls, ten-cycle resource routes and 1,152 finite response scenarios.
`status=complete` in target rows means the ground-normal follow-up ended; inspect
`aerialAccepted` and `slideStartTick` to distinguish a full aerial/slide route from
interruption or a crouched landing. These are scenario measurements, not balance proof.

### Ground grab and forward throw

Grab commits to 7 startup, 3 front-only active, and 18 whiff-recovery ticks.
It snapshots facing on acceptance, including when leaving an unstunned shield;
block stun prevents admission. Cooked per-character `captureGeometry` defines the
short forward volume and restraint anchors. Hurtbox overlap and stage collision
determine capture; neither target lock nor Unity animation moves the victim.
Reciprocal active grabs clash with 10 recovery ticks. An accepted damaging hit
resolves before capture and interrupts a linked pair before its release.

In the Editor, enable Scene or Game **Gizmos** to see the cooked forward grab box
while `GrabAttempt` runs: yellow startup, orange active contact, gray whiff
recovery. `PlayerRenderer` places it using Shared position and captured facing;
it does not add a Unity collider or change targeting.

Unity plays the shared `grab.fbx` during `GrabAttempt` and switches directly to
the shared `throw.fbx` on capture. Both clips are non-looping and are bound once
in `Resources/AnimationConfigs/Shared_AnimConfig.asset`, independently of each
character's package animation catalog. Playback samples the replicated remaining
phase ticks: the 28-tick attempt or 12-tick throw. Whiffs return to locomotion,
Hitstop freezes the pose, and rollback can rewind it; no grab-idle/hold clip or
animation event decides capture, damage, or release. Grab uses C on keyboard
(rebindable) or LB+RT on controller.
The Edit Mode menu **Tools → SlopArena → Tests → Grab Animation Presentation**
checks tick sampling, replay/Hitstop, attack cancellation cleanup, direct throw,
release, and Hitstun interruption on an isolated rig without changing the open scene.

Capture restrains both fighters for 12 ticks. The automatic forward throw deals
6 damage and launches at 30° along the captured facing, using the ordinary
weight/percent/DI knockback path with base 5 and growth 26 (FightGuy's
non-finisher forward sweeping/double kick tuning). The grabber then has 12
recovery ticks. Release is targeted, not an area hit; missing or invalid partners
unlink without throwing. Training and the GameServer use the same Shared rules;
online prediction waits for the authoritative paired outcome.

Initial throw launch report (hypothetical light weight 50, heavy weight 150;
the four admitted packages currently author weight 100). Values are initial
velocity magnitude after global 0.17 launch scaling, before DI or decay:

| Victim pre-throw % | Light 50 | Heavy 150 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 7.516 | 4.510 |
| 50 | 10.463 | 6.278 |
| 100 | 13.410 | 8.046 |
| 150 | 16.356 | 9.814 |

## Damage and hit response

SlopArena uses damage percent rather than a conventional health pool. A hit applies damage, then Knockback using the hit's profile and the victim's current percent. Profiles cover Light, Medium, Launcher, Kill, Spike, and explicit Custom values.

- **Hitstun** is the victim's no-action duration after a damaging hit. Inputs buffer according to the simulation rules; residual launch continues after Hitstun ends.
- **Hitstop** freezes the attacker/victim pair briefly on contact while the match clock continues. Block hitstop does not enter damaging-hit launch/DI logic.
- **Block stun** locks a defender after a blocked contact for `clamp(ceil(0.6 × incoming damage) + 2, 4, 15)` ticks; overlaps retain the larger remaining duration.
- **Shield drop** lasts 7 vulnerable ticks after release; release during block stun starts the full drop only when the stun expires.
- **Clash** resolves simultaneous Interruptible hitboxes as mutual pushback and short stun instead of an arbitrary trade.
- **Armor** is an authored activation window, not invulnerability: incoming
  damage/contact feedback and Hitstop remain, but ordinary launch, Hitstun and
  SDI do not apply. The contact snapshots protection before Hitstop; no deferred
  launch appears when the window expires. Grabs bypass armor.
- Ordinary Hitstun is derived from launch magnitude; `stunTicks` is a gate.
  An opt-in hitbox `fixedHitstunTicks` gives a bounded linking duration without
  increasing displacement. It does not bypass armor or a zero stun gate.

Visual hit reactions, VFX, audio, and camera effects are presentation only. Damage and state transitions occur in Shared simulation.

## Duration locks and interruption

A Duration Lock prevents action during an authored move commitment. The engine owns interruption:

- IASA lets an authored stage accept a new ability from its configured tick onward;
- grounded normals also accept directional movement at that same pre-tick IASA boundary; movement cancels the current activation and its remaining hitboxes rather than steering an active attack;
- explicit ability input takes priority over movement cancellation; hitstop, Hitstun, block stun, and landing lag still block cancellation, and jumping retains its existing full-lock gate;
- Hitstun, death, and simulation-owned overrides cancel active content through the cancellation path;
- landing lag applies to an aerial move unless the landing tick is in its auto-cancel window;
- a cancellation never depends on an authored cleanup operation that may not execute.

`IasaTicks = 0` and `LandingLagTicks = 0` preserve the default no-early-out/no-landing-commitment behavior. Auto-cancel windows are per air stage.

During positive grounded landing lag, Unity blends the current aerial pose into idle
over the remaining replicated `LandingLagTicks / 60` seconds. Ordinary and
auto-cancelled landings do not trigger the blend. Hitstun interrupts it, and zero
landing lag returns animation ownership to locomotion immediately. This presentation
never extends the gameplay lock.

## Hitboxes and projectiles

The Shared resolver owns collision. A move can issue fixed-position, capsule, sphere, bone-attached, or projectile operations through its cooked timeline or an approved trusted capability. The resolver handles:

- facing-relative and cooked-pose bone positions;
- entity collision and owner-hit rules;
- projectile velocity, gravity, lifetime, and ground contact;
- explosion queues and lingering rehit zones.

No Unity physics query or client-only trajectory determines gameplay.

## Targeting and aiming

The client may provide camera-derived aim and target intent. The Shared simulation validates targetability and range and owns the selected target. Target lock is passive while moving: it does not steer facing outside attacks. Supported attacks snap toward the locked target; without lock, `TrackingStrength` closes that fraction of the shortest yaw difference per 60 Hz tick. Hitstop pauses attack tracking. Unity renders the resulting authoritative facing and lock indicator.

The Gameplay target-lock setting has three modes: **Always auto-lock** (default) acquires an enemy automatically; **Never auto-lock** requires manual activation; **Auto-lock on hit** activates when the fighter deals or receives a damaging hit. An active lock keeps its target while valid within 20 m rather than switching as the camera moves. Retarget selects the nearest valid enemy within 20 m; the lock toggle explicitly disables or reenables automatic locking. If a target leaves range, automatic modes may reacquire when one returns, but explicit lock-off remains off until reenabling. Manual camera-facing snap does not disable lock.

A fresh lock toggle or retarget resolves its new candidate before invalidating the
previous target. If no eligible candidate exists, lock remains off. Shield freezes
combat facing without stopping authoritative target selection or lock acquisition.

Aim indicators and camera movement are visual input aids. They do not bypass server validation or replace Shared simulation.

## Design rules

- Give 3D attacks enough width, height, or depth to compensate for camera perspective, while preserving readable counterplay.
- Telegraph high-damage F moves with a wind-up so Shield and movement decisions matter.
- Make aerial strength and recovery resources part of the fighter's tradeoff rather than granting every move unrestricted air use.
- Keep move behavior deterministic, bounded, and expressible through engine-owned primitives.
