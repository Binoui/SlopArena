# Wibou — The Kitsune Blade
> **Package-native character.** The canonical kit contract is the package-native 16-entry grid: grounded and aerial variants of `1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / A / E / R / F`. `LMB` and `RMB` are camera controls, not persisted move identities. Authoring source lives under `client/Unity/Assets/CharacterPackages/wibou/`; cooked runtime content is admitted through the Match Content Catalog.
> Status: Included in the cooked roster. Legacy Shared registry definitions are retired; new changes must use the package compiler, asset catalog, cooked package, and Match Content Catalog path.
> Current Q/A is Shuriken Toss, not the Counter in the historical concept below. Ground and air fire three projectiles after 8 startup ticks, with no manual aim, crosshair, hold, or release phase. Shared aims at the current server-selected target's torso at launch, retaining the ±15° spread; it uses the nearest eligible opponent within the existing 20 m horizontal targeting range if the selection is invalid, or fires level along combat facing if none exists. Projectiles do not home. The imported `kunai.fbx` model remains cosmetic; Shared retains all flight and hit authority.
> Current R/Dash Slash uses the public `slop.ability.charged-directional-dash.v1` primitive for ground and air. Hold manual directional aim; release locks direction with no target assistance or later steering. Tier 2 starts at 20 ticks, tier 3 at 45, and charge caps at 60 without auto-release. Distance scales continuously from 1.2 to 6.4 m at 10.5 m/s. A weak hips/torso traversal hit deals 1 damage once per opponent; the independent sword hit deals 6/9/12 damage during the last four travel ticks and seeks animation tick 31. Dash phases through fighter pushboxes only: shields and terrain stop it, attacks can interrupt it, and it grants no invulnerability. Release ends in 24 ticks of committed recovery, including on whiff; charge and dash remain interruptible.
> Current sword VFX: the Wibou weapon config references `CFXR4 Sword Trail TECH (360 Thick)` for its shader, mask texture, color gradient, and authored dissolve curves. Unity bends those style inputs onto a short-lived blade-sweep ribbon connecting recent `bladeHilt` and `bladeEnd` poses; it does **not** instantiate the prefab's one-shot 360° mesh. Baked blade emission starts at the authored hilt-to-tip hitbox trigger and follows the swing through its animation duration, independently of the damage-window end. Hitstop pauses ribbon/particle aging with the pose, including the final frozen snapshot. A stationary sword produces no new area; closing or interrupting the swing stops emission and lets the existing tail fade over the configured 0.12 s, even when an attack-only weapon hides. Death, teleport, and a new attack/stage identity clear old history. Damage and hitbox lifetimes remain Shared-owned.
> Inspired by: **Marth** (spacing, reach, punish, counter, exploitable recovery) × **Amaterasu** (DKO — fast agile sword, launcher, air-juggle payoff).

## Approved presentation accent — 2026-10-02

Wibou's character accent is **Matrix/hacker green**, shared by sword VFX and ability-icon blades/arcs. The current weapon config's trail GUID resolves to `CFXR4 Sword Trail TECH (360 Thick)`, inheriting `(360 Spiral)` with base RGB `(0.5673758, 1, 0.41134745)`; its flat 8-bit icon equivalent is **`#91FF69`**. The particle/material HDR boost is not reproduced as UI glow. This replaces the undecided foxfire accent in the historical concept below; it does not approve a model/costume redesign.

Grounded-normal icon readings: **G1 forward-reaching downward sweep; G2 forward-reaching rising sweep; G3 vertical rising swing; G4 downward hit**. Icons simplify the dominant active portion, omitting return hooks that imply a different action. All selected poses/paths remain inside their authored hitbox windows. Full active-only blade/hitbox measurements remain separate and must not be replaced by these cropped art compositions.

The four transparent 512px icon samples, 50px-interior/70px-frame previews, and source/tick/color provenance are under `.impeccable/review/wibou-grounded-blade-icons-20261002/`. Artwork is individually fitted to a 448px safe area inside each 512px export, preserving proportions: about 44px on its long edge at native HUD size, with a small margin and no slot enlargement. Measurement plots retain their common scale; icon framing is not a reach comparison. These are inspected art samples, not yet wired runtime icons. Shared gameplay, existing VFX assets, normal/special category frames, damage-tier colors, and global menu colors are unchanged.


## Concept

A **kitsune (fox spirit) swordswoman** — agile, precise, trickster-elegant. Where **FightGuy** is a close-range fists-and-ki execution brawler and **Manki** is an explosive zoner, Wibou owns the **mid-range sword game**: a disjointed blade used aggressively to control space and stay glued to the opponent at the edge of its reach, then convert a clean hit into a vertical air juggle.

Fox-spirit theme gives a distinct roster silhouette (monkey / human / fox) and natural VFX flair — **foxfire** trails on slashes, tails flourishing on spins and the counter riposte.

*Species/gender chosen (female kitsune), name locked (**Wibou**); exact palette and tail count still to refine — see Open Decisions.*

## Archetype

**In-your-face spacing duelist.**
- Neutral: out-space with **disjointed blade reach** and aggressive mid-range pressure. Uniform hit quality — **no positional sweetspot / tipper** (positional sweetspots are unreadable in 3D alongside warp + lunge).
- Payoff: convert a hit into **launch -> air juggle -> finish** (the "fun" of the kit).
- Mobility: agile, for **repositioning and spacing**, not stealth/escape. Not a full run-in rushdown — a pressure-at-range fighter.
- **Designed weakness:** weak once an opponent gets *inside* the blade (classic Marth flaw) and an **honestly exploitable recovery** (see below).

### Local gamefeel tuning — 2026-10-02

Wibou retains the fastest Run at 14 m/s. Air cap remains 7 m/s and air
acceleration 16 + 3.2 m/s². Jump/short-hop impulses remain 12/7.8 m/s;
gravity is reduced to 32 m/s², with fall/fast-fall caps unchanged at 14/22 m/s.
Source-compiled Shared measures full hop **43 ticks / 2.151 m** and short hop
**27 ticks / 0.887 m**.

Normals use approximately 1.05× previous durations, preserving the fast end of
the roster. Contact windows and auto-cancel thresholds follow the stretched
animation; landing lag, geometry, rewards and specials are unchanged.

| Normal | Duration | IASA | Hit trigger / active length |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| ground.1 | 63 | 28 | 13 / 12 |
| ground.2 | 63 | 23 | 9 / 7 |
| ground.3 | 63 | 26 | 14 / 7 |
| ground.4 | 74 | 63 | 41 / 15 |
| air.1 | 27 | 23 | 6 / 8 |
| air.2 | 25 | 21 | 4 / 5 |
| air.3 | 27 | 23 | 10 / 7 |
| air.4 | 36 | 31 | 8 / 8 |

All entries are authored 60-Hz ticks. Ground normals retain at least four inactive
ticks before another ability, eight for ground.4. Shared lifetime/IASA probes
passed; this is source-only Editor tuning, not updated cooked content.
Live Lab/Training alignment verification awaits the retained Editor owner.

### Grounded animation correction — 2026-09-15

The package catalog binds corrected `.anim` assets for idle, Run, grounded normals,
and specials. Idle, Run, and grounded 1 now share the animation pack's recommended
T-pose Avatar, as grounded 2 already did; animated first-frame Avatars are not
interchangeable reference poses.

- Idle's normalized body-height reference is `0.924141`. Preserve authored body Y
  against that common reference instead of recentering each clip's initial crouch.
  E retains its existing, separately centered body curves.
- Grounded 3 is rebuilt from `M_katana_Blade@Attack_4Combo_3_Inplace.FBX`.
  Grounded 4's missing body translation is restored from `M_katana_Blade@Skill_H.FBX`,
  mapped onto its existing edited timeline without changing its other curves.
- A, R, and F regain body translation from the matching `Skill_E`, `Skill_A`, and
  `Skill_G` sources. Authored airborne poses remain airborne.
- Target-rig Humanoid foot IK and sole-clearance corrections are baked into these
  animation assets. Runtime foot IK and root-motion movement remain disabled:
  playback and subsequent pose cooking consume the same corrected source clips.
- Run retains its original `0.533333 s` cycle and corrected foot poses. The initial
  `0.2101266 s` stride-matching attempt looked too frantic in human playtesting and
  was reverted. Gameplay remains `15 m/s`; some sliding is accepted in preference
  to accelerated leg motion. The native playback window covers the full cycle.
- `presentation.modelYOffset` is now `+0.194`, superseding the idle-only `+0.286`
  compensation. Automatic offset stays disabled; collision dimensions and gameplay
  values are unchanged.

Verified through the transient Editor development catalog: all eight grounded slots,
Run → idle, and jump → landing → idle. The corrected bindings and poses are now
included in the cooked Wibou package and its refreshed roster requirement.

### Historical grounded IASA tuning — 2026-09-15

This earlier pass introduced the movement/attack IASA boundary. Its values
remain a historical record; the local source candidate above supersedes them.

| Slot | Previous IASA | Tuned IASA | Intent |
|------|--------------:|-----------:|--------|
| `ground.1` | 21 | 24 | Delay cancellation past the final hitbox |
| `ground.2` | 30 | 22 | Shorten recovery |
| `ground.3` | 28 | 25 | Shorten recovery |
| `ground.4` | 39 | 53 | Delay cancellation past the final hitbox |

The timing pass changes only these IASA values; move durations, hitboxes, aerial data,
and other gameplay fields remain unchanged. The transient Editor development catalog
remains the local iteration path. These values are now included in the cooked package
and admitted roster alongside the grounded animation correction.


## Design Pillars

### Predictable knockback, emergent combos
Every ability has **consistent, learnable knockback** (angle + magnitude, scaling with %). Combos are **discovered by the player**, not scripted into the kit. Smash's philosophy, not DKO's fixed launch-chains. No ability is wired to "feed into" another — R reliably launches up, aerials have honest KB, and the juggle *emerges* because the values are readable.

> This pillar is broader than one character — it describes the game's intended combat feel. Consider promoting it to `docs/systems/combat-systems.md`.

### Recovery is a system, not one move
Recovery is spread across slots and is deliberately **functional-but-exploitable** (the character's signature weakness):
- **E** (charged dash) — horizontal distance, scales with charge.
- **Air LMB** (3-hit) — stall / slight drift, buys airtime.
- **R** (rising slash) — capped vertical height when whiffing in empty air (the flaw); only "extends" when it actually connects with an enemy.

## Kit

| Slot | Name | Role | Mechanic |
|------|------|------|----------|
| **LMB** | Light Slash Combo | Light attack | 3-4 hit slash chain, modest KB finisher |
| **Air LMB** | Air Slash (3 hits) | Aerial / juggle-sustain | 3-hit air slash, predictable upward KB, fall-stall |
| **RMB** | Charged Spin | Heavy / **kill move** | Tap = horizontal poke; Hold = charged spin = big horizontal launch (blast-zone kill) |
| **Air RMB** | Falling Slash | Aerial heavy / spike | Hold to charge: tap = quick slash (9 dmg); charged = heavier slash (13 dmg). Strong downward KB, edgeguard/finisher |
| **Q** | Counter | Counter / read | Parry window -> riposte **launches** attacker (knockback, no lingering stun) |
| **E** | Charged Dash Slash | Mobility / gap-close | Tap = short reposition, Hold = full gap-close; horizontal recovery; no stun |
| **R** | Rising Slash | **Signature** launcher + juggle + vertical recovery | Multi-charge homing uppercut; charge refunds on hit -> sustains juggle; capped self-height on whiff |
| **F** | Blade Flurry | Burst / finisher | Committed moving multi-slash flurry, ends in a hard launch; telegraphed, punishable on whiff |

## Gameplan

Control mid-range with LMB pokes and the disjointed blade -> land a hit or gap-close with E -> **R** to launch -> chase with double-jump/dash + Air LMB, re-launching with R (charges refund on hit) -> cash out with **RMB (charged)** for the kill at high %, or **Air RMB** to spike off-stage. **Q (Counter)** punishes opponents who try to rush inside your range.

## Weaknesses
- **Inside the blade:** loses to characters who get past the reach and pressure up close.
- **Recovery:** functional but exploitable — mostly horizontal (E) + capped vertical (R on whiff). Vulnerable to edgeguarding.
- **Commitment:** RMB charged spin and F are telegraphed; whiffing is heavily punishable.
- **Counter is a read:** whiffing Q leaves a vulnerable window.

## Open Decisions (implementation-time only)

Kit is fully specified. Remaining items are tuning/art, not design:

1. **Palette** — species/gender/name locked (female kitsune, **Wibou**). Open: exact palette (foxfire color, fur color), tail count.
2. **Numbers** — all damage / KB / charge counts / CDs / charge-refund timing TBD; tune in implementation against `character-kit-design-principles.md` baselines.
3. **Q = Counter** — locked as v1 but flagged "a bit lazy"; revisit after playtest depending on how oppressive rushdown feels in practice.

## Animation Needs (soft constraint)

- Grounded and aerial normals `1`–`4` — package slots `ground.1`–`ground.4` and `air.1`–`air.4`.
- `A`, `E`, `R`, and `F` specials — package slots `ground.a`/`air.a`, `ground.e`/`air.e`, `ground.r`/`air.r`, and `ground.f`/`air.f`.
- Movement, hit reactions, and recovery clips remain presentation bindings; gameplay timing comes from the cooked timeline.

## Package files
- `client/Unity/Assets/CharacterPackages/wibou/package.json` — package identity and attribution.
- `client/Unity/Assets/CharacterPackages/wibou/character.json` — gameplay semantics and canonical 16-entry grid.
- `client/Unity/Assets/CharacterPackages/wibou/CharacterAssetCatalog.asset` — package-local Unity bindings.
- `content-cooked/wibou/` — immutable cooked runtime package admitted by the roster manifest.

See `docs/characters/character-kit-design-principles.md` for design patterns and `docs/systems/combat-systems.md` for universal combat mechanics.
