# Manki — Mad Bomber Monkey


> Status: Package-native authoring source cooked and rostered. The canonical kit contract is the package-native 16-entry grid: grounded and aerial variants of `1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / A / E / R / F`. `LMB` and `RMB` are camera controls, not persisted move identities.
> Package source: `client/Unity/Assets/CharacterPackages/manki/`; cooked runtime: `content-cooked/manki/`.
> Inspired by: Ziggs (LoL) × rushdown brawler — pyromaniac mad inventor monkey

## Concept

A pyromaniac/inventor macaque monkey. Always tinkering with explosives — bombs, dynamite, aerosols. Wears overalls stained with gunpowder and hole-ridden work gloves.

## Archetype

**Floaty explosive skirmisher / Jetpack-bazooka hybrid** — sustained airtime and strong aerial repositioning distinguish Manki from FightGuy's baseline.
- Poke with round bombs, zone with aerosol flame, control space with Q pressure
- Recover vertically with Jetpack Boost (E), then regain air drift at the apex
- Gameplan: poke with Q → commit with ground combo → Jetpack Boost to recover → rocket jump for air follow-up
- E is a 3-tick vulnerable compression followed by one small ignition hitbox; horizontal input is sampled once at ignition
- R is fast fire-and-forget poke with rocket jump utility; aim at feet for vertical launch, aim at distant enemies for explosive poking
- F is a committed area-denial finisher with a tall forward hitbox

### Local gamefeel tuning — 2026-10-03

This source-only Editor pass supersedes the September movement values:

- Run 11.5 m/s; air cap 9 m/s; air acceleration 20 + 4 m/s².
- Jump/short-hop impulses 10.4/6.6 m/s; gravity 24 m/s².
- Fall/fast-fall caps 11/18 m/s; squat, jumps and air-dodge tuning unchanged.

The October 3 adjustment partially rolls back excessive floatiness: gravity
18 → 24 and fall/fast-fall caps 9/15 → 11/18, retaining jump impulses so both
height and airtime decrease without another impulse reduction.

Source-compiled Shared measurements: full hop **50 airborne ticks / 2.167 m**
(previously 67 / 2.918); short hop **31 airborne ticks / 0.853 m** (previously
42 / 1.155). Fresh descending Down reaches **-18 m/s**, with full/short-hop
airtime **33/19 ticks**. Both hops take off and land. The initial 6.3 m/s
short-hop candidate snapped back to the floor; the approved 6.6 is retained.

Normals use approximately 1.15× previous durations with matched contact windows,
IASA and auto-cancel thresholds. Landing lag, hit grouping, geometry and reward
are unchanged. Grounded recovery has at least four inactive ticks before another
ability, eight for ground.4. Special timings and the F hold/fire/alias path are untouched.

| Normal | Duration | IASA | Hit trigger / active length |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| ground.1 | 35 | 18 | 9 / 6 |
| ground.2 | 58 | 26 | 9 / 6 |
| ground.3 | 44 | 29 | 9 / 12 |
| ground.4 | 69 | 64 | 12 / 8 |
| air.1 | 38 | 33 | 7 / 6; 18 / 6 |
| air.2 | 48 | 41 | 8 / 6; 14 / 23 |
| air.3 | 51 | 48 | 16 / 7 |
| air.4 | 62 | 57 | 23 / 8 |

All entries are authored 60-Hz ticks. Shared lifetime/IASA probes passed; cooked
content remains unchanged. Live Lab/Training alignment and human feel are not
yet accepted; the retained Editor owner controls that verification window.

## Kit

| Slot | Name | Visual | Mechanic |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| **LMB** | Monkey Combo | 3 hits: punch → kick → fire uppercut | Melee rushdown, launcher on final hit |
| **RMB** | Aerosol + Lighter | Shake aerosol (hold) → cone flame (release) | Two-phase charge: tap = quick burst (8 dmg), hold >45 ticks = charged (14 dmg) |
| **Air LMB** | Air Kick (2 hits) | Two air kicks | 2-hit combo, first kick lunges, second has higher KB |
| **Air RMB** | Knuckle Spike | Double knuckle punch down (hold to charge) | Two-phase charge: tap = quick spike (10 dmg), hold >45 ticks = charged spike (14 dmg). Downward, high KB |
| **Q** | Round Bomb | Lob round bomb in arc → explodes on impact | Poke / zone, aimable air + ground |
| **E** | Jetpack Boost | Compression → ignition launch | 3 vulnerable startup ticks; 15 m/s vertical, normalized 3.5 m/s horizontal cap; 1.25m ignition sphere, 4 damage, 75° / 2+8 KB, 8 stun, 4 ticks; no ascent steering; air drift returns at apex |
| **R** | Bazooka | Short cast → fire rocket in camera direction | FPS-style fire-and-forget. Projectile arcs, explodes on impact. Rocket jump (4 self-dmg) |
| **F** | Aerosol Inferno | Hold aerosol can → release into a tall orange flame column | Hold-to-aim while stationary; camera yaw tracks facing; release attack fires after 18 ticks; 15 damage, 55° launch, 30 ticks stun |

## Local cooldown tuning — 2026-10-03

Round Bomb's ground and aliased air cooldown is **240 ticks / 4 s**, reduced
from 300 / 5 s. The explosive mobile-aim option remains costlier than a plain
two-second projectile without changing its reward, aim hold or release timing.
E/R/F remain **210 / 240 / 600 ticks** (3.5 / 4 / 10 s); normals remain zero.
These are playtest tuning values, not a match-balance verdict. Cooldown begins
on completion/cancellation, so time spent aiming is separate. Source-compiled
Shared ground/air timer and expiry probes passed; persisted cooked content and
roster pins are unchanged.

## Design Notes
- **E**: Jetpack Boost. On activation, Manki compresses for 3 vulnerable ticks while preserving vertical fall velocity and clearing horizontal velocity. On ignition, the authoritative simulation samples the current movement stick, normalizes it when above 0.001 magnitude, and launches at `VY=15` with horizontal speed `3.5` along that direction. A single owner-centered sphere (radius 1.25, damage 4, 75° angle, base 2, growth 8, stun 8, duration 4) resolves the ignition hit. The ascent is unsteerable; gravity is active immediately, and normal air drift/actions return when `VY <= 0`. Cooldown: 210 ticks. The move is a recovery move and aliases `air.E` to `ground.E`.
- **R**: Bazooka (FPS-style). Short cast (20 ticks), fire a rocket projectile in camera direction (AimYaw/AimPitch). Projectile has gravity (15 m/s²), speed 40 m/s, max flight 45 ticks. Explodes on entity hit or ground contact with 3m AoE. CanHitOwner=true on explosion — aim at feet for rocket jump (4 self-damage, upward knockback). No rise, no hover, no hold-to-aim. 240 tick cooldown (4s).
- **F**: Aerosol Inferno. Hold enters the loop animation and freezes horizontal movement. Manki follows camera yaw only; vertical aim is ignored. Release switches to the attack animation, then emits the right-hand aerosol VFX and forward flame hitbox at the authored 18-tick trigger. Cooldown: 600 ticks.

## Previous Design

This character was initially designed as a **Fire Dancer / rushdown acrobat** (pure fire, full melee). The kit was redesigned in June 2026 to reposition him as a **pyromaniac/mad inventor** with explosives, while keeping a rushdown base. See git history for the old kit version.

See `docs/characters/character-kit-design-principles.md` for the canonical kit contract and `docs/systems/combat-systems.md` for universal combat mechanics.
