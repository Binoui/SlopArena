# Ability Lab

## Purpose

Ability Lab is SlopArena's internal fighter/move authoring and debugging environment. It is a package-first UI Toolkit editor shell.

## Usage

Open `Tools → SlopArena → Ability Lab` with the existing Ability Lab scene component. Select a source package from `Assets/CharacterPackages`; the selector shows its display name and package ID while persisting only the package ID. FightGuy opens as `fightguy` with Ground `1` selected.

The preview is read-only and rooted. It loads the last verified cooked package from staged `Application.streamingAssetsPath/content-cooked` or the repository `content-cooked` directory, in that order. It never depends on the process working directory and never cooks when the window opens. In Edit Mode, stop playback at tick `0`, use the timeline slider or bounded `−1`/`+1` controls, and inspect the existing SceneView rig, baked bones, hurtboxes, and hitboxes.

`SAVE + COOK` is the only path that persists source and cooks artifacts. `Cooked`, `Stale`, `Cook failed`, and structured diagnostics expose package authority and binding problems. An unavailable package never falls back to a legacy character.
In the Moves tab, drag a marker or hitbox body to a snapped source tick. Drag the narrow hitbox right edge to resize its active endpoint. Changes commit once on release through the package workspace; Escape cancels a drag, and Undo restores one release. Use the `0.5×..4×` Zoom control with horizontal scrolling for dense timelines. While stopped in package Edit Mode, click an active resolved hitbox in SceneView and use its radius handle; radius edits use the same source-owned Undo path. Compatibility and unavailable, playing, or non-Moves states have no package handles.

Compatibility is a separate read-only tab with a persistent legacy-authority banner. It is the only path that may use the legacy `CharacterClass`/`LegacyCharacterCatalogAdapter` flow. Package mode and Compatibility mode do not share persisted move identity.

## Ownership

Ability Lab owns editor and preview tooling. Core gameplay data and simulation remain owned by SlopArena/shared runtime code. Canonical package move identity is the Shared `CanonicalSlotProjection` (`ground.*` then `air.*`); human labels are UI adapters.

## Direction

The tool may eventually become the basis of a standalone creator tool, so Ability Lab-specific code should stay isolated from unrelated game code.

## Dependency rule

Prefer:

```text
AbilityLab → SlopArena gameplay/shared code
```

Avoid:

```text
SlopArena gameplay → AbilityLab
```
