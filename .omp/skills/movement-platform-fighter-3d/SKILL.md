# SlopArena Movement and Platform-Fighter Fundamentals

Use this skill for movement, input, and universal combat changes. The authoritative implementation is `src/Shared/ServerSimulation.cs`; Unity gathers input and renders state. Read [`docs/architecture-overview.md`](../../../docs/architecture-overview.md), [`docs/systems/combat-systems.md`](../../../docs/systems/combat-systems.md), and [`CONTEXT.md`](../../../CONTEXT.md) before changing settled mechanics.

## Movement contract

- Input is camera-relative and snaps to eight directions. The camera is a world sibling with absolute yaw.
- Ground movement has one Run tier. Rush is the fixed reversal-free burst from standstill; Turnaround is the committed reversal from a full Run.
- Ground and double jumps use per-character movement data. ShortHop is release-timed during JumpSquat; double jumps are full jumps.
- JumpArc is the complete jump animation. Fall starts when the JumpArc finishes while the entity remains airborne, not at the physics apex.
- FastFall sets the configured downward speed while airborne and falling, except during Hitstun.
- Dash is the Shift-triggered evasion/approach burst. Its opening ticks grant DashInvincibility. Ground Dash hard-stops at expiry; aerial Dash preserves momentum.
- LedgeHang is occupied and single-occupancy. Drop, ledge jump, and stand are explicit actions.
- FloatWindow is restored by landing, taking damage, or RecoveryMove. Normal air attacks do not reset it.

All durations are 60 Hz simulation ticks. Do not implement movement from render-frame delta time.

## Input boundary

`InputController.Poll()` and `BuildInputState()` produce `SlopArena.Shared.InputState`. The input state carries movement, jump, Dash, Burst, canonical active slot, camera aim, target intent, JumpHeld, facing-camera edge, and target-lock toggle fields. The client may provide intent; the server validates and applies gameplay.

The canonical move grid is grounded and aerial variants of `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `A`, `E`, `R`, and `F`. Physical controls are remappable adapters. They are not package identity.

NPCs use generated/training inputs rather than keyboard state. Keep AI input on the same Shared simulation path as player input.

## Simulation order

When changing movement, trace the actual order in `ServerSimulation`:

1. timers and per-entity locks;
2. hitstop, Hitstun, Knockback, and death/respawn handling;
3. active timeline/capability execution;
4. Dash, Burst, jump, and slot activation gates;
5. normal ground/air movement and gravity;
6. terrain, ledge, landing-lag, and auto-cancel resolution;
7. hitbox/projectile resolution and authoritative state/event output.

Preserve server authority. Client prediction and rollback replay the Shared rules; they must not add client-only corrections for gameplay mechanics.

## Combat invariants

Damage uses percent, not an HP depletion rule. Knockback is resolved from the hit profile and current percent. Hitstun, Hitstop, Combo Influence, Clash, Burst, IASA, landing lag, air-use counters, and DashInvincibility are simulation-owned. See [`docs/systems/combat-systems.md`](../../../docs/systems/combat-systems.md).

Use pure Shared math for collision and displacement. Unity physics, animations, VFX, and camera effects are presentation or input aids only.

## Change checklist

1. Read the domain term in `CONTEXT.md` and the relevant ADR before changing a settled mechanic.
2. Trace input → Shared state → movement/combat transition → rendered state.
3. Reuse existing `MovementStats`, `CharacterState`, `InputState`, and resolver fields.
4. Add a behavioral Shared test for a new boundary or transition.
5. Run:

```bash
dotnet build src/Shared/ --nologo
dotnet test tests/Shared.Tests/ --nologo
```

For Unity-facing changes, use the Unity CLI recompile and console gate described in [`docs/contributing/unity-cli.md`](../../../docs/contributing/unity-cli.md).
