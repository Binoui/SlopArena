# SlopArena Stage Design

## 1. Purpose and boundary

This skill is the interactive, conversational workflow for designing one stage's visual composition. It produces exactly two deliverables:

- a locked Stage Design Brief at `docs/design/stages/<key>.design.md`, and
- approved gray-box blockout screenshots in `.stage-authoring-cache/<key>/design/`.

It must NOT run `sloparena.stage.bake`, `sloparena.stage.inspect`, asset-selection or provenance work, material authoring, or lighting polish. Those belong to [`sloparena-stage-authoring`](../sloparena-stage-authoring/SKILL.md), which begins only after LOCK (section 5). The only Unity content this skill creates is gray-box primitives (cubes/cylinders/spheres, colliders destroyed) and at most one temporary light.

## 2. Inputs

- [`docs/design/stage-concepts.md`](../../../docs/design/stage-concepts.md) is required reading and must be read first. It exists and defines the design contract.
- The typed production commands `sloparena.stage.bake` and `sloparena.stage.inspect` exist at the paths documented by [`sloparena-stage-authoring`](../sloparena-stage-authoring/SKILL.md); this design workflow must not run them.
- For an existing stage: the gameplay-shell section of `docs/design/stages/<key>.md` and the baked arena are fixed constraints. The design may re-mass cosmetics, but never proposes new collision, spawns, or boundaries — those require the production skill's gameplay path.
- **Blast-plane clearance (the ONE background rule).** The bake derives kill planes from the collision mesh: side planes at mesh bounds ± `ArenaCollision.SideBlastMargin` (10), kill height at minY − 10, top blast at highest surface + 20. The corridor between the planes is player-death space — an ejected fighter flies through it until crossing a plane. Background geometry must not intersect that corridor: nothing an ejected player would visibly pass through, no surface at landable height inside it. The `sloparena.stage.design-capture` command draws translucent red kill-plane walls and reports the planes as numbers, so this is checkable per iteration. It is fine that the stage limit itself reads softly; it is never fine for players to fly through terrain when ejected.
- **Platform reachability rule of thumb (shell design).** Calibrate against the roster reference character, not intuition: read `jumpForce`/`gravity`/`airJumpVMultiplier` from `content-cooked/<character>/character.runtime.json` (FightGuy reference: single-jump apex ≈ 2.0, double-jump apex ≈ 3.3; `src/Shared/AI/MovementProbe.cs` computes exact per-character metrics). Level-1 platform: top ≈ single apex (one well-timed jump, trivial with double). Level-2 platform: top above double apex — unattainable from the floor even with a double jump, close enough that a character's body grazes it; reachable with a double jump from a level-1 platform. Reference implementation (industrial_rooftop HVAC decks): L1 top 2.01, L2 top 4.43.
- **Gray-box captures judge massing only; prop placement is arithmetic + numeric verification.** Flat captures cannot reveal whether a window sits on a building's face or floats 2 units off it. Two concrete traps, both observed: (1) parenting a prop to a scaled cube multiplies the child's local position/scale by the parent's scale — windows landed at x=−180; either compute WORLD positions from the parent's renderer bounds (`face ± halfProp + embed`) or divide local values by parent scale; (2) destroying objects while iterating the transform skips entries — collect targets into a list first. Standard recipe: place props in world space computed from the building's bounds (window center = face ± (propHalfDepth − embed)), then verify with a bounds dump (every prop overlaps its host on the two tangent axes and protrudes on the face axis) — never by trusting the yaw captures.
- **If the shell itself is the problem** (layout, routes, boundary shape feel boring or unjustified), that is a gameplay change, not a cosmetic re-mass. Design the shell concept conversationally first — fight premise, named route purposes, spawn plan, ASCII top-down — then implement it through the production skill's gameplay path (collision scene → bake → ArenaShipping tests → human PVP review), and only then run this visual design session on the new shell.

Early layout talk should prefer terminal-ASCII wireframes. They are throwaway thinking tools, not deliverables.

## 3. Wireframe loop (gray-box + design-capture)

Iterate visual massing with throwaway scripts, then capture with the typed design-capture command:

1. Write a throwaway C# script to `/tmp/<name>.cs` with NO `using` directives and NO class/method declarations — the `unity command eval_file` Roslyn wrapper compiles the file as the body of a generated `Execute()` method (so a trailing `return` supplies its result), and all `UnityEditor`/`UnityEngine` types must be fully qualified. Pattern:

   ```csharp
   string prefabPath = "Assets/Resources/Stages/<key>.prefab";
   // The gray material MUST be persisted. Two traps, both observed rendering magenta:
   // - an in-memory Material is not saved by SaveAsPrefabAsset (reference lost);
   // - a .mat under a dot-folder (Assets/.stage-capture-cache/…) is not imported by
   //   Unity, so its GUID never resolves. Store it as a sub-asset of the prefab.
   UnityEngine.Material gray = System.Linq.Enumerable.FirstOrDefault(
       System.Linq.Enumerable.OfType<UnityEngine.Material>(
           UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.LoadAllAssetsAtPath(prefabPath)),
       m => m.name == "DesignGray");
   if (gray == null) {
       gray = new UnityEngine.Material(UnityEngine.Shader.Find("Universal Render Pipeline/Lit"));
       gray.SetColor("_BaseColor", new UnityEngine.Color(0.6f, 0.6f, 0.6f, 1f));
       UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.AddObjectToAsset(gray, prefabPath);
       UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.SaveAssets();
   }
   var root = UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.LoadPrefabContents(prefabPath);
   string result;
   try {
       // destroy or add primitive children: cubes/cylinders/spheres for masses;
       // destroy their Colliders; assign `gray` to each MeshRenderer
       UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAsset(root, prefabPath);
       result = "ok";
   } finally {
       UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.UnloadPrefabContents(root);
   }
   return result;
   ```

2. Render five supporting deterministic edit-mode views:

   ```bash
   unity command --project-path client/Unity \
     sloparena.stage.design-capture --stage <key> --format json
   ```

   This writes four yaw quarter-turns (`design-north/east/south/west.png`) plus an orthographic `design-top.png`. The top view exposes routes, bridge line, and busy/empty zoning; the yaw views expose all-direction massing. The JSON result also reports the derived kill planes (`minX/maxX/minZ/maxZ/killHeight/killTop`) for numeric background-clearance checks, and the yaw views draw translucent red kill-plane walls so clearance is visible, not just computed. This is an edit-mode render of the prefab as it exists on disk.

3. **After every meaningful composition change, the human reviewer enters Play Mode and reviews the stage through the real in-game camera.** Move, jump, and rotate freely from the main floor, every accessible platform, and the recovery/death-space views. Check that the world reads as a 3D place; that nearby façades, windows, and ramps have believable depth; and that background geometry neither masquerades as a route nor visibly intercepts an ejected fighter. The agent records the observations and iterates the gray box. Optional in-game screenshots may be kept in `.stage-authoring-cache/<key>/design/` as discussion evidence.
   Ask these questions in that review; they turn vague impressions into decisions:

   1. Does the playable shell feel good enough to fight on from the real camera?
   2. Do bridges, joins, and route transitions read as intended without suggesting a false route?
   3. Does the background establish a three-dimensional world rather than a set of panels?
   4. Does each small accessible platform have a clear purpose and feel worth using?
   5. Could a player mistake background for a safe route? If they try it, do they cleanly blast rather than collide with visible terrain?
   6. Which gray-box forms must survive into production, and which are placeholders for real assets?

   This is a visual-design review, not the production workflow's external 2–4-player PVP acceptance. It establishes presentation readability before LOCK; it does not prove final gameplay usability.

4. After `eval_file` creates or edits assets, the pipeline server can drop for ~10 seconds. Wait and retry with `unity status` rather than retrying the capture — observed behavior, not a workflow failure.

5. Saving into the real cosmetic prefab `client/Unity/Assets/Resources/Stages/<key>.prefab` is expected and safe mid-design: the production session replaces it wholesale, and the lock capture is the durable artifact.

Design captures are supporting evidence for silhouette, massing, camera-region composition, busy/empty zones, landmark placement, and numeric clearance. They are not a substitute for the human in-game review, material-quality review, prop-provenance work, or numeric placement verification.

## 4. Decision vocabulary

Composition decisions MUST be written in gameplay-camera region language — "from the default camera: left third / center / right edge / foreground bottom" — never world coordinates, because the player reads the stage through the camera, not the scene view.

The match camera (`CameraMount` + `CinemachineOrbitalFollow`) orbits with FREE 360° yaw (pitch clamped 0–45°, mouse-driven zoom). Composition MUST therefore hold from every yaw angle, not one. State the yaw vantages the stage must read from — at minimum four quarter-turn views (N/E/S/W of the stage) — plus any stage-pinned vantage (for example, looking out from a raised deck). A background mass on one side only leaves void in the other three; single-direction backdrops are a defect, not a style.

Include a "busy here / empty here" zoning statement.

## 5. LOCK protocol

The session ends by:

1. Reading the numbered decisions back to the user for explicit sign-off.
2. Confirming that the user completed the in-game visual-design review in section 3 and that its observations are resolved or explicitly accepted.
3. Writing the Stage Design Brief per section 6, front matter `status: locked` and `locked:` dated, only after that sign-off.
4. Stating that production (`sloparena-stage-authoring`) may now run.

"Locked" means the brief plus the screenshots. It does not replace the later external human PVP acceptance.

## 6. Stage Design Brief format

Path: `docs/design/stages/<key>.design.md` — sibling of the production brief; `<key>` is the immutable stage key.

Front matter:

```yaml
---
key: <stage key>
status: draft | locked
locked: <YYYY-MM-DD, set only on sign-off>
approved_by: <user>
blockout:
  - .stage-authoring-cache/<key>/design/lock-default.png
---
```

Body sections, each mandatory:

- `## Personality` — exactly one sentence: the stage's joke.
- `## Composition decisions` — numbered, in camera-region language, covering every major mass, the landmark, foreground clusters, surface treatment, and the SCENE WORLD: what exists below the stage, above it, and at far distance so the fight sits inside a believable place rather than on a platter.
- `## Negative decisions` — explicit exclusions that bind production: no second hero landmark, no clutter on gameplay routes, no background geometry through the blast corridor, and any stage-specific exclusions.
- `## Palette & lighting` — time of day, ambient temperature, accent colors: names and vibe, not hex or material specs.
- `## Camera vantages` — list.

Screenshot paths are cache references; never commit binaries.

## 7. Who decides what

The split between this skill and production (`sloparena-stage-authoring`): design decides WHAT should exist and why; production decides HOW it is made real.

| Decision | Design | Production |
|---|---|---|
| Fight premise, routes, floor shape, spawns | Decides (shell concept) | Implements via collision scene → bake → tests |
| What masses exist, where, in camera language | Decides (numbered decisions) | Places to match; reports PASS/DEVIATION |
| What must NOT exist | Decides (negative decisions) | Bound hardest by these |
| Palette & lighting DIRECTION (time of day, accent vibe) | Decides | — |
| Lighting/material EXECUTION (lights, skybox rig, materials) | — | Decides, within the locked direction |
| Surface treatment INTENT ("one plane, two seams") | Decides | Chooses actual materials/textures |
| Asset provenance, LODs, performance | — | Owns entirely (asset-selection skill) |
| Background/skybox STORY (below, above, far distance) | Decides (scene world) | Builds within the story |
| Gray-box blockout screenshots | Produces (lock evidence) | Replaces with real content |
| Any collision/spawn/boundary change | Proposes only (→ gameplay path) | Executes + bakes + tests |

The test for "whose call is this?": would a different implementation still be faithful to the brief? If yes, production has latitude. If changing it would break the stage's joke or a locked decision, design owns it. Anything unresolved between the two phases goes to the user as an explicit DEVIATION, never silently resolved by either side.
