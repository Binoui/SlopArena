# SlopArena Move Data Report

`scripts/move-data.sh` wraps `tools/MoveDataReport` (dotnet console, `net8.0`). It runs the **real shared sim**
(`ServerSimulation` + `Simulation.ApplyKnockback`, ADR-0019 flight law) for a character's Custom-knockback
normal hitboxes at several victim damage percents, and writes a markdown report. No xUnit, no assertion, no
golden file — pure telemetry for a human to read. Reference: `docs/systems/move-data-report.md`.

## Usage

```bash
scripts/move-data.sh <char> [--pcts 0,30,60,90,120,150] [--out docs/generated/<char>-move-data.md]
scripts/move-data.sh <char> --json report.json --html report.html   # visual report
scripts/move-data.sh <char> --truecombos --di --html report.html    # + true-combo graph + DI escape-space
```

- `<char>`: `fightguy` (default) | `kistu`. `manki`/`nilus` resolve but produce empty reports — they are not
  Melee-converted to Custom-knockback normals yet (see caveats).
- Default markdown output: `docs/generated/<char>-move-data.md`.

### Analysis modes (issue #147)

- `--truecombos` — freeform true-combo reachability graph: for each normal × hit state (grounded/airborne)
  × %, the real sim runs the starter and attempts every follow-up (greedy chase, IASA early-out press).
  **T** = follow-up landed while the victim was still in hitstun, **F** = landed after stun expired,
  `-` = never. Per-edge window tightness (`sim stun − recovery − follow-up trigger`) + per-% combo density.
  **Finding (2026-08-17): both characters currently have zero true combos** — the sim derives hitstun from
  launch speed (`0.5 ×` unscaled KV; authored `StunTicks` is a zero/nonzero gate) and `KbScaleFactor 0.14`
  carries the victim out of reach before any follow-up can activate. Combos are reads/movement, by construction.
- `--di` — DI escape-space: each trajectory re-run with the victim holding each stick direction through
  hitstun (`in`/`away` = MoveY ∓/±1 along the launch axis, `up`/`down` = MoveX ±1 perpendicular), rotated by
  the sim's real `ApplyDirectionalInfluence` (18° cap, Melee sin² curve). Max launch-vector deviation =
  escape magnitude — low = DI-resistant (reliable kill tool), high = DI-bendable (escapable). Overlaid on
  the knockback-shape gallery.

## Visual report (`--json` / `--html`)

The tool also emits a **lossless JSON** report and a **self-contained HTML** visual report (no external
deps). The JSON is a per-tick dump (100s of KB-low MB) — **gitignored**, regenerate on demand; only the
`.html`/`.md` renderings commit under `docs/generated/`. One richer collection feeds both; the markdown
path is unchanged.

- `--json <path>` — structured: per-move frame data, per-tick trajectory arcs, adv per move×%, kill% + blast clearance.
- `--html <path>` — three human-readable sections:
  - **Frame-advantage heatmap** — rows = moves, columns = victim %, cells colored green(+)→red(−) by adv; click a column header to sort.
  - **Knockback shape gallery** — small-multiple SVG arcs (height vs travel) per move × %, apex dot, KV/stun/apex labels.
  - **KO & blast clearance** — kill % (lowest victim % crossing a blast line) + bars for how close each move gets to top/side blast.
- **Kill % geometry**: binary search 0→250%, lowest % at which the launch crosses a blast line on a
  **Crossroads-style 60×60 proxy** (top +20, sides ±40, bottom −10), center launch, no DI. Blast clearance
  is the fraction of the way to top/side blast at the highest simulated % — always populated.
- **Finding (2026-08-17):** no normal KO ≤ 250% on the proxy — knockback magnitudes are small vs blast-zone
  distance. Read clearance to see "up-slash apex is 43% of the way to top blast."

## What it reports (the core — frame advantage lives here)

**1. Frame data (authored)** — pure constants from the ability spec, no sim: trigger, active window,
damage, angle, base KB, growth, stun, IASA, landing lag, auto-cancel before/after, total duration.
Instant answer to "how long is this attack / when does it hit?"

**2. Per-hit trajectories (simulated)** — one row per hitbox × per victim %, the knockback shape:
`KV m/s | hitstop | stun | adv | advL | rise@stun | drift@stun | apex | actionable tick | landed tick`.
- **`adv`** = on-hit frame advantage = `stun − (IASA − trigger)`. Positive = attacker acts before the victim
  leaves hitstun. **This is the headline number.**
- `advL` (aerials) = landed follow-up pays landing lag.
- Method: fresh grounded victim at that %, launch via the real `ApplyKnockback` with the hitbox's authored
  values, step the sim until landing (cap 2400 ticks). No DI/SDI; hitstop reported but not simulated.

**3. Pipeline parity** — safety: runs the *real* hit path (input → baked-bone hitbox → `ResolveHits` →
hitstop queue → queued launch) and compares applied KV/stun/apex vs the direct-formula rows. Any `DIVERGE` =
the game behaves differently from the report. Existing because the 2026-08-14 x87 float bug silently
scaled nothing while .NET tests were green.

## Opt-in / experimental — NOT part of the design loop

- `--combos` — combo matrix (no-travel bound `TA < stun`) + movement probes (greedy AI chase, real sim).
  Encodes **scripted route strings**, which contradict the freeform-combo design goal. Keep it as a
  diagnostic only; do not build balance decisions on it.
- `--traj <slot>` — raw per-tick CSV launch trace for one grounded hit.
- `--shape [step]` — knockback feel surface: sampled arc every ~0.2s per hit per %, phase markers
  (H=hitstun/F=flight/A=apex/G=landed) + one-line KV/stun summary.
- `--pipe`, `--dll <path>`, `--parity` — internal diagnostics (see
  `docs/contributing/unity-cli.md` for the Unity CLI/Pipeline parity check and in-game
  launch-contract sentinel comparison).

## Caveats (read before trusting a report)

- **Every move is included regardless of knockback profile.** Frame data (active / duration / IASA / stun)
  is always exact. Trajectories use the resolved launch: Custom/Adaptive use their authored base/growth;
  named profiles (Light/Medium/…) resolve from the profile table.
- **Adaptive (Melee-361) moves** (e.g. Kistu's Quick Slash / Air Slash / Reverse Slash) are simulated with
  their **authored angle as a representative** — the real launch angle varies with hit position (a level hit
  sends flatter). Tagged `adaptive` in the HTML report with an in-report caveat; frame data is unaffected.
- **Multi-hit moves false-positive parity.** A 2-hit starter (e.g. Kistu g2 Double Slash) re-launches the
  victim with hit 2 in the pipeline run, inflating pipeline apex vs the single-hit direct row → `DIVERGE`.
  KV/stun still matching is the signal it's an artifact, not a real drift.
- **Manki / Nilus produce empty reports** until their kits are Melee-converted. That is correct, not broken.
- **Per-character combo routes:** only FightGuy has authored routes in `RoutesFor` (`DefaultRoutes`). Add a
  char's designed links there to get its combo matrix.
- Hitstop is reported (`ComputeHitstopTicks`) but not simulated — flight starts at launch.

## When to run

- User asks for attack duration, active frames, frame advantage, knockback shape/range, or a move-data table.
- After a balance/timing change to a character's normals — regenerate and read the diff as the changelog.
- If a report disagrees with in-game feel, run `--parity` and compare with the launch-contract
  sentinel using the Unity CLI workflow in `docs/contributing/unity-cli.md`.

## Character normal audit — all eight normals

Use this workflow when the request is to assess a character's ground and air normals as a
kit: whether the animated contact matches its hitbox/hurtbox timing, and whether damage,
knockback, timing, and role form a coherent Melee-inspired normal tier.

The deliverable is an **evidence-backed role proposal**, not a report dump and not an
animation-only opinion. Complete the evidence pass before proposing data changes; in the
interactive main session, explain the proposal and wait for approval before editing.

### Applicability and source of truth

- Audit the full normal tier: `ground.1`–`ground.4` and `air.1`–`air.4`. Treat each
  `SpawnHitbox` operation as an independently authored contact, not merely each input label
  as one move.
- Server simulation is authoritative. Read the package's `character.json` and cooked
definition; for legacy Nilus maintenance, use the existing
  `LegacyCharacterCatalogAdapter` definition. Use `HitboxGeometry.ResolvePositions` /
  `ServerSimulation.BuildEntitiesFromState` geometry and simulation outcomes. Never infer
  gameplay behavior solely from a client animation.
- Ability Lab is the visual truth surface: it scrubs the same sim-tick pose, green hurtboxes,
  and orange hitboxes that the server resolves. See `docs/systems/ability-lab.md`.
- The report requires usable normal data. Kistu's Adaptive moves are representative-angle
  trajectories; Manki/Nilus currently produce empty reports until their normals are
  Melee-converted. Record that as a prerequisite, not as a balance verdict.

### Evidence pass

1. **Inventory authored data.** For every ground/air normal, record name, animation, trigger,
   active range, duration, IASA, landing lag/auto-cancel, shape, radius, bone/end bone,
   damage, angle, base KB, and growth.
2. **Build and record the real sim.** Run markdown and HTML separately so both committed
   renderings are refreshed:

   ```bash
   dotnet build src/Shared/ --nologo
   scripts/move-data.sh <char> --pcts 0,30,60,90,120,150 --truecombos --di --reach \
     --out docs/generated/<char>-move-data.md
   scripts/move-data.sh <char> --pcts 0,30,60,90,120,150 --truecombos --di --reach \
     --html docs/generated/<char>-move-data.html
   ```

   Read frame data, trajectory rows, pipeline parity, true-combo reachability, DI
   escape-space, and the reach ladder. A `DIVERGE` parity row blocks conclusions until
   resolved.
3. **Scrub contact geometry in Ability Lab.** Select each ground and air slot, jump to every
   hitbox trigger, then scrub through `trigger + duration - 1`. Check the animated limb/capsule
   against the green attacker hurtboxes, orange hitbox, and an optional red dummy at intended
   spacing. Repeat for early/late events and all multi-hit contacts.
4. **Audit overlap semantics.** Adjacent sweetspot/sourspot or body-covering events that are
   meant to produce one hit must share a nonzero `HitGroup`; verify a stationary target does
   not take both hits. Intentional separate contacts must retain distinct hit identities.
5. **Interpret the real outcome.** Do not treat authored `StunTicks` as actual hitstun:
   under ADR-0019 it is a zero/nonzero gate, while launch speed determines actual stun.
   A move is a true combo starter only when the real-sim graph reports **T**; **F** and `-`
   are not combo claims.

### Role decision

Give each normal one primary job. Common roles are quick low poke, forward spacing/check,
cross-up/side check, vertical anti-air, body-covering linger, aerial two-hit check, grounded
kill read, and forward-air kill read. Roles may share a secondary use, but two moves must not
silently become the same tool.

Judge a proposed role from all four evidence sources:

| Evidence | Decision it supports |
|---|---|
| Active tick + IASA / landing lag | commitment, whiff cost, and whether the move is fast or deliberate |
| Baked pose + hitbox/hurtbox geometry | whether the contact is visually honest and covers its intended space |
| Real launch, stun, DI, and blast clearance | poke, anti-air, launcher, or kill-read reward |
| True-combo graph + reach ladder | whether a claimed route exists and which spacing/height gap the move fills |

### Audit record template

Write one compact card per normal in the review or character documentation:

```text
<slot> <move>
Role: <one primary role>
Animation contact: <limb/capsule and active ticks>
Hit model: <shape, anchors, radius, HitGroup behavior>
Reward: <damage, angle, KB; real 0% and high-% outcome>
Cost: <startup, total, IASA, landing lag>
Evidence: <reach / DI / parity / combo verdict>
Decision: <keep or exact change and reason>
```

### FightGuy worked example — 2026-08-19

The completed FightGuy pass is the reference shape:

| Normal | Final primary role |
|---|---|
| g1 Low Kick | quick low neutral poke |
| g2 Straight Punch | fast mid-range forward check |
| g3 Sweeping Kick | lateral/cross-up check that lifts upward |
| g4 Double Kick | slow grounded horizontal kill read |
| a1 Double Punch | two-contact airborne poke |
| a2 Floating Kick | body-covering sex kick; strong early, weak late, one hit total |
| a3 High Kick | high-angle aerial anti-air |
| a4 Air Smash | late committed horizontal aerial kill read |

The evidence artifact is `docs/generated/fightguy-move-data.md`; the pose check used Ability
Lab; `tests/Shared.Tests/FightGuyNormalTuningTests.cs` pins the revised timing, geometry,
damage, and launch contracts. Its report found no true normal links at 0–150%, so the final
roles deliberately do not promise automatic combos.

### Preserve and verify an approved retune

1. Update the ability specs and role names/descriptions together; migrate factory comments,
   character documentation, and tests so old role names cannot mislead later tuning.
2. Add focused `KitScenario`/golden coverage at an active contact tick. Pin hit confirmation,
   damage, single-hit grouping, and a representative launch; use the
   `sloparena-kit-regression-testing` workflow for scoped golden generation and review.
3. Rebuild Shared, regenerate both report renderings, and run affected regression tests.
4. Request a Unity recompilation check. For Unity-facing behavior, add a short manual
   Training/Ability-Lab checklist to `TESTING-UNITY.md`: contact alignment, coverage,
   one-hit semantics, reward, commitment, and target-lock/manual-aim behavior.

## Verify / flow

1. After a Shared change, rebuild first: `dotnet build src/Shared/ --nologo` (DLL auto-copies to Unity Plugins).
2. `dotnet build tools/MoveDataReport/ --nologo`.
3. Run, read the markdown, sanity-check numbers against `docs/characters/<char>.md` / the ability spec.
4. Commit regenerated `docs/generated/*.md` alongside the behavior change if it should be a changelog artifact.
